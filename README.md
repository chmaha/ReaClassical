Everything you need to do professional classical editing in REAPER for free. Please begin by visiting the [website](https://chmaha.github.io/ReaClassical/) and reading the [PDF guide](https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/raw/main/PDF_Guide/ReaClassical%20User%20Guide.pdf).

For a full ReaClassical experience read the [Installation guide](https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/blob/main/install_instructions.md).

To just use the scripts, jsfx plugins, theme, default template but without keymaps, toolbar etc, import my repository into ReaPack by copying and pasting [this link](https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/raw/main/index.xml).
