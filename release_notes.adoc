=== Release Notes for ReaClassical 25.x

[discrete]
==== Ongoing Changelog: https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/commits/main/

[discrete]
==== Instructions for a new portable install:

. Run the latest portable install as per the
https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/blob/main/install_instructions.md[installation
guide] (it will create a new ReaClassical folder with a short year +
quarter suffix e.g. ReaClassical_25). Double-click on the REAPER binary
inside the folder!
. Follow the update instructions below to get the latest and greatest
ReaClassical functions, toolbar and keymap.

==== Instructions to update a ReaClassical portable install:

. Run the ReaClassical_Updater function found in the actions dialog (or
use the shortcut shift+U). This will sync ReaPack to get the latest
ReaClassical functions then offer to overwrite your toolbars and keymaps
with the latest ReaClassical portable install defaults. *DON'T answer
yes to either of these questions if you have your own custom toolbars or
keyboard shortcuts as they will be overwritten!*
. Run the REAPER Update Utility (Ctrl+U) to upgrade to the latest tested
version of REAPER as noted
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/main/tested_reaper_ver.txt[here].

==== ReaClassical Core: Basic manual install of just the S-D editing tools inside your existing REAPER Install

To just use the S-D editing functions and my jsfx plugins without any customization of keymaps, toolbar etc:

. Install both ReaPack (https://reapack.com/) and latest SWS Extensions (https://www.sws-extension.org/download/pre-release/) if you haven't already
. Import my repository into ReaPack by copying and pasting https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/raw/main/index.xml[this link]. If you need help with importing see https://reapack.com/user-guide#import-repositories.
. Search for "ReaClassical Core" and install the metapackage and any jsfx plugins (my "RCPlugs" are highly recommended for classical work). 
. Set up keyboard shortcuts in the actions list (? shortcut) as desired.
