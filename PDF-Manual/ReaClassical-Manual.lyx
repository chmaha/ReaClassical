Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
It is important to note that if you already own REAPER then the world of
 classical editing including source-destination editing (aka 2-, 3-, and-4-point
 editing), crossfade editing and more are available at no extra cost to
 you via the freely available ReaClassical system.
 There’s no need to spend any of your hard-earned money on Sequoia, Pyramix
 or SaDiE in order to make editing precise and efficient.
 As a classical engineer myself, I can say with certainty that what I am
 about to share with you covers all my recording, editing and mastering
 needs.
 Indeed, I couldn't return to the old way of working at this point.
 Your mileage may vary and I’d love to hear from you if there are functions
 that you feel might be missing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
This Manual
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This PDF manual serves as the official manual for ReaClassical.
 The latest version is always available directly online or offline from
 within ReaClassical by pressing 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{H}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

help
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

).
 The benefit of the offline version is that it is always in sync with the
 version of the tools you are using.
 The structure of the manual is designed to take the user through preliminary
 remarks, install and update procedures for both ReaClassical and REAPER
 then a detailed look at workflows from creating a project through to final
 render.
 After some brief closing remarks, there follows the appendices (descriptions
 of all the ReaClassical functions, keyboard shortcut guide, recommended
 free mastering-grade plugins, system tweaks for all three major OSes, and,
 finally, a manual install guide mainly for academic purposes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I highly recommend doing a complete read of the manual and becoming very
 familiar with appendices A and B.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

 serves as the entry point for new users.
 From here you can read about key features, donate to the cause, read this
 PDF manual, installation instructions, navigate to the ReaClassical community
 thread and more.

The 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "community thread"
target "https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=265145"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 plays an important role in the development of ReaClassical.
 Not only is it a place for users to suggest feature requests and point
 out bugs but also discuss more general classical music recording, mixing
 and mastering techniques.
 It also serves as something of a development blog as I not only announce
 the regular releases but also document the under-the-surface details for
 those that are interested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Ways to Contribute
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important way users can contribute to the development of ReaClassical
 is to actually use the tools! I makes me happy to know that engineers can
 make whole professional-sounding and technically accurate masters from
 ReaClassical.
 Another is to suggest features or let me know about bugs.
 You can either do this on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "thread"

 or via the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Issues"
target "https://github.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/issues"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 page on the ReaClassical github.
 Finally, I'd be glad of any monetary donations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Development Style
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to working on github and releasing the functions via ReaPack, I have
 the ability to push bugfixes and new features very quickly into an existing
 ReaClassical install.
 Often bugfixes happen within minutes or hours of receiving the report.
 When I dream up new features, the development often happens in rapid fashion
 over the course of a few days.
 However, now that ReaClassical has what I consider a mature feature set,
 I foresee maintenance and occasional bugfixes becoming more central to
 the process.
 This will give me more opportunity to work on this documentation, a complete
 video tutorial series etc.
 Part of development is also ensuring that ReaClassical continues to operate
 as expected with the latest REAPER versions.
 That's not to say there won't be new features appearing! As the REAPER
 devs add more new features, I will always check to see what might be useful
 for ReaClassical.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Versioning Style
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical currently uses YY.MINOR.MICRO versioning (e.g.
 24.2.1) which is a sort of hybrid between SemVer and CalVer styles.
 The short year acts as the major version with minor numbers increasing
 for new features and the micro number increasing for smaller changes such
 as bugfixes.
 At the very least the short year gives a sense of how recent the ReaClassical
 version is.
 Another popular piece of software that uses the same versioning style is

Updating an Existing ReaClassical Portable Install

To update just the functions, use 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
menu{Extensions > ReaPack > Synchronize packages}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 To update the functions and also update/reset the custom toolbar and keymaps
 to be in line with a standard ReaClassical portable install, run the handy
 ReaClassical_Updater function found in the actions menu via 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{?}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 This will sync ReaPack to get the latest ReaClassical functions then offer
 to overwrite your toolbars and keymaps with ReaClassical portable install
 defaults.
 
\series bold
DON'T do this if you have your own custom toolbars or keyboard shortcuts
 as they will be overwritten! 
\series default
However, as of 24.8.7 any files will first be backed up (e.g.
 
\emph on
reaper-kb.ini.backup

).
 Obviously if you run the updater twice before recovering them you will
 lose your original files.

.
 These settings are operating system dependent.
 Choice of blocksize etc is also dependent on need and how modern and/or
 optimised your system is.
 For general microphone setup, device and recording settings specifically
 for classical music etc I recommend referring to one or more of the following:

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing

 The next three lines are for 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

literal "false"

\end_inset

 creation.
 The defaults are for a 200ms track offset (to account for older CD players
 that couldn't play audio immediately after a track search), the INDEX0
 length in seconds for when to start a CD player 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

countdown
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 display to the next track (a fun visual trick that is, of course, completely
 irrelevant for purely digital releases) and, finally, the album lead-out
 time in seconds (essentially the time on a car CD player before the disc
 returns to the beginning again).
 Finally there is a setting for the Prepare Takes function to either use
 the old random coloring method or the newer color scheme that uses blues
 for destination material and greens for source material.
 There will be more on these settings in subsequent sections of the manual.
 If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, I recommend a quick internet
 search! If in doubt, just use the default values.
 It is worth noting that these preferences are set per project.
\end_layout

Choice of Workflow

The choice between what I refer to as

\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 or

\end_inset

horizontal
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 workflows will depend somewhat on the complexity of the project.
 For a quick editing session of, say, a choral piece or short self-standing
 orchestral piece, a horizontal approach will suffice.
 For a well-drilled ensemble recording session, I can recommend using the
 vertical approach.
 Many classical engineers enjoy using a horizontal approach for recording
 (potentially the least disruptive and making use of the Take Counter window

 ) or, depending on the number of takes, converting to a vertical workflow.
 Frankly, there are benefits to both routes, and in the end, it simply comes
 down to personal preference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Vertical Workflow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this approach, the source and destination track groups are aligned vertically
 so that the user doesn't have to shuttle back and forth along the timeline
 for placing source-destination markers.

 Whether recording or importing, simply type in the total number of stereo
 and mono microphone inputs you need.
 I highly recommend using the first track for the main stereo pair.

 to set up a destination track group and six source groups (don't worry,
 it's easy to add more if you need them!).
 Simply type in the number of tracks you need.
 I highly recommend using the first track for the main stereo pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

 and creates a single set of mixer tracks that are shared by the groups.
 Use these to control volume, panning, polarity, sends and FX across all
 takes.
 The function also sets up media item and razor editing grouped by folder.
 If you need more than the six source groups, simply create them on the
 fly with the 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 (Classical Take Record) creates a new source group as needed after each
 recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical scenario: You have vertically recorded, or vertically prepared,
 multiple takes of a concerto movement with 10 channels.
 You realise halfway through editing that you want the soloist’s microphone
 to be brought up in volume a little and also panned slightly more to the
 right to match the position in the main stereo pair.
 Simply make the change once on the equivalent mixer track!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Horizontal Workflow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this approach, there is a single track or single group of tracks with
 the source and destination material laid out from left to right.
 As mentioned above, for shorter pieces of music this is often a perfectly
 acceptable approach.
 With the introduction of the Find Takes function and Take Counter, many
 will now prefer this workflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin a horizontal workflow, press 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to set up a track group also with mixer tracks (for making changes to volume,
 pan, polarity, sends and FX).
 Whether recording or importing, simply type in the number of tracks or
 microphone inputs you need.
 I highly recommend using the first track for the main stereo pair.
 In the event you are making a simple stereo recording, I would still recommend
 creating a track group consisting of two tracks and simply leave the child
 track empty and hidden.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever your workflow preference, as of 24.10, all audio is routed through
 a special dedicated mixer tracks leading to an RCMASTER bus.
 This allows for independent volume adjustments on the parent track which
 is generally used for the main microphone pair.
 Converting your projects made with an earlier version of ReaClassical is
 easy.
 Simply run

 for vertical workflows.
 The new mixer tracks and bus will be created and all routing taken care
 of.
 Any existing track panel settings (including sends and FX) from the first
 group are automatically transferred to the mixer tracks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any and all track setting changes (volume, pan, phase, FX, sends to @aux
 tracks, routing to #submixes etc) happen in the mixer tracks.
 This is identical to the way that Pyramix works with a single mixer being
 fed by all the source groups.
 The mixer tracks are always visible in the mixer panel and identified by
 track names that start with

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you have decided on a workflow, we can set up the tracks for recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setting Inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple ways to set recording inputs on REAPER.
 First is to click on the input at the top of the mixer channel.
 Second, you can left-click on the meter part of the track panel.
 Third, you can press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to open the routing matrix.
 Once you have set the inputs for the first group, and you chose a vertical
 approach, simply press 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to sync these settings to all source groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Headroom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, I refer you to the books on classical music production but in general
 I suggest aiming for around -12dB peaks on the meters.
 24-bit recording allows for a lot of headroom so there's no need to push
 close to 0dB.
 Adjust the individual faders to balance.
 Note that in a vertical workflow moving a fader will automatically move
 the corresponding fader in the other groups too making same-volume auditioning
 of different takes extremely easy.

 recording mode for whatever parent track is selected.
 If the parent isn't record-armed (probably the case before you start your
 first recording of the session), the function will first simply record-arm
 the group so you can usefully monitor incoming signal.
 On a subsequent press of 
\begin_inset ERT

 recording begins.
 To stop recording, press

 ReaClassical will automatically create new groups as required.
 To manually add more destination groups when not recording, press 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 to track the upcoming take number (in green) and take number during recording
 (in red with recording circle).
 You can right-click on the window to set a take number to increment from
 and set a session name to act as media subfolder (which is automatically
 recalled when the window is reopened).
 You can left-click to recalculate the track count if you have removed some
 unused files from the project path.
 The calculated upcoming take number factors in unused files in the project
 path so as to avoid any file-naming conflicts.
 Please read the description of the function in Appendix A for best practices.

\begin_layout Subsection
Adding a New Microphone Mid-Recording Session
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of ReaClassical 24.9 you can add a track to all folders in the project
 at once by using the shortcut 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
shift+T}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It will prompt you for a name and then add a new track with that name to
 the end of each group.
 This also works for a single folder while working in a horizontal workflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Disabling Channels During a Recording Session
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a typical recording session, the musicians with the least to record are
 often allowed to leave the session early once their work is completed.
 If they were individually recorded using a spot microphone, it wouldn't
 make sense to continue recording on that channel.
 In ReaClassical there are two main ways to disable a channel.
 In a horizontal workflow using a single folder, it is no hassle to simply
 un-arm the desired track(s).
 For a vertical workflow with multiple folders, the task could end up being
 time-consuming with potential for error.
 So, the recommended ReaClassical way, both easy and visually obvious, is
 to select the desired tracks in the destination group, right click and
 choose 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

lock track controls
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

.
 The tracks are then greyed out.
 Then sync using F8 and the same tracks are locked in every group.
 Whether or not the tracks were previously record-armed, those tracks will
 no longer be involved in the recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Importing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Read this section if you recorded using a different DAW, portable recorder
 or are acting solely as editor and have the audio ready to import into
 ReaClassical.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Importing Media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set up the horizontal or vertical workflow as desired.
 Then either drag the audio into the REAPER window or select 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
menu{Insert > Media file...}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For classical music purposes, you can then choose whether to insert in the
 same time position on separate tracks or sequentially on a single track.
 For recordings with multiple takes using separate files, I recommend inserting/
dragged one take at a time onto separate tracks on either the source group
 or first destination group.
 Once everything is imported you can then drag sets of tracks to the different
 source groups as desired.
 If you have a best take that will be the basis of the final edit, place
 this on the top destination group tracks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-Channel Audio Import
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use a portable recorder such as a MixPre, you might have a multi-channel
 combined file.
 ReaClassical includes a special function for converting these into a stereo
 pair + mono track set.
 Import your multi-channel media using a single regular track (for a horizontal
 workflow) or multiple regular tracks (for a vertical workflow).
 Then, simply select all your multi-channel sets and press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F10}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Answer yes to the prompt that appears if the first two channels should
 be treated as stereo interleaved (i.e.
 they represent your main pair).
 Depending on the choice made, the number of tracks in the resulting folder(s)
 will adjust accordingly.
 If the user selects ‘no’ to keep all tracks mono, the folder track is left
 empty so that the Prepare Takes 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{T}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 function is able to create a muted guide track (more on this later!).
 Obviously if you decide to move to a vertical workflow after exploding
 using a single track, you can always use 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F8}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to create your source folders then drag the media to where you want them.
 Note that it is important to select all the items you want to explode as
 the function can only be used once (prior to folders existing).
 If you need to bring in new takes after editing has started, simply use
 the function on an empty project tab then copy or cut them into the original
 project tab into the desired folder on the timeline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Navigating a Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to built-in REAPER functions, ReaClassical uses a series of
 shortcuts to help you easily navigate your classical project.
 Important: I always make some dedicated time post-recording to get a lay
 of the land, tidy up the digital notes I took during the session and perform
 a backup on an external drive as soon as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Naming Tracks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical automatically adds Source and Destination prefixes to your
 chosen track names and are auto-renumbered whenever functions affecting

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\begin_layout Subsection
Parents & Children
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical can hide or show children of track groups.
 This means that editing multi-track classical music can be as easy as editing
 a stereo track.
 When takes have been prepared (see below), all edits are automatically
 synchronised.
 Making an edit to the parent track automatically makes the same one to
 all the children too.
 To show hidden children select the parent track and press

Summary of Track Types in ReaClassical
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While some of these will be covered later in the manual, it is useful to
 give a summary of track types you can currently use in ReaClassical.
 First, we have the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

regular
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 group or groups of tracks shown in the arrange window.
 These are where you record or import takes.
 You can record-arm tracks and select inputs here (a reminder that names,
 recording inputs and locked tracks need only be set on the first group
 and then 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F8}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can be pressed to sync across all groups.
 Second, we have the mixer tracks designated via 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

M:
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 prefix.
 These tracks shown only in the mixer are where you adjust the usual track
 controls such as pan, volume, phase etc.
 and also add FX.
 Third, we have aux busses designated via 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 prefix.
 You can route mixer tracks to these to use as a reverb bus etc.
 Fourth, we have submix busses designated via 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

#
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 prefix.
 You can route mixer tracks to these as a way to collect together microphones
 from the same orchestral section etc.
 Fifth, we have a dedicated room tone track where you can place recorded
 or generated room tone (more on this in the mastering section).
 Sixth, we have the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

RCMASTER
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 bus which leads directly to the master REAPER bus.
 Here you can gain stage into the master bus, add FX etc.
 Finally, the master bus itself where again you can set final levels, add
 FX etc.
 As mentioned elsewhere, try not to delete the mixer tracks or RCMASTER.
 But, even if you do by accident, simply run 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction to Editing Workflows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have recorded or imported your classical music audio, you are ready
 to start editing the raw material! Here we talk about the meat and potatoes
 of the classical editing workflows.
 Workflows—plural—because I have included different approaches to suit as
 many tastes as possible within the confines of the REAPER application.
 I will explain each in detail after this brief introduction.
 As described previously, you have multiple ways of proceeding.
 First you can have all your takes lined up in a row horizontally and you
 place your source in and out markers, destination in and out markers then
 press a keyboard shortcut to achieve your 2-, 3- or 4-point edit.
 The second way is to set up your takes vertically and then either use the
 same marker system to make your edits or use razor edits (my preferred
 method when working vertically).
 Whichever option you choose, you will then end up in the crossfade editor
 view which uses a custom two-lane view with classical crossfade function
 to make precise edits really easy in REAPER.
 I don’t often use the fade editor dialog that comes with REAPER even though
 I make it appear as part of the function.

Marking Edits on your Scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is best done using a physical, photocopied score by the conductor or
 lead musician.
 I advocate for a “T” system where a large T is inserted into the score
 at the intended edit point.
 Either side of the T stem, and under the crossbar, the outgoing and incoming
 take numbers are written.
 A wavy crossbar indicates some leeway for where the edit point can be placed.
 Further notes can be attached underneath the T such as directions for tightenin
g the gap etc.

 (the default), for horizontal workflows, two shades of blue are used which
 also helps show the user where edits happen.
 For vertical workflows, the destination group again uses two shades of

 In this way they match the colors of the associated S-D markers.

 Prepare Takes can be re-run at any point to re-sync colors, especially
 useful when using the default color scheme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you imported or recorded all your files in child tracks, the function
 will additionally copy all items from each first child track into the folder
 track and mute them to act as a visual guide track.
 You will receive a pop-up message if this is the case.
 In the cases where you might use the function after editing has begun,
 the destination group will switch to using alternating colors for items
 so that you can easily tell where you have made edits.

\begin_layout Subsection
Auditioning Takes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For horizontal editing, you can use the usual transport shortcuts (spacebar
 to start and stop playback, for example).
 For vertical (and horizontal) editing, it is highly recommended to use
 the Audition or Exclusive Audition functions to quickly solo only the folder
 (or track) you are interested in hearing.
 Just hover the mouse over the parent for the full mix or a child to solo
 a spot microphone you want to hear and press 
\begin_inset ERT

 depending on how many markers you set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You’ll also notice that because you prepared the various takes with colours
 (and grouping), it is really easy to see which takes compose your final
 edited tracks.
 It’s worth pointing out that my S/D and classical crossfade functions place
 the crossfade immediately before the entry and exit points of the pasted
 audio.
 The crossfade length and other values can be set on a per-project basis
 via ReaClassical Preferences (
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F5}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 In practice this means that if you visually set a marker (or edit cursor
 in the case of the classical crossfade function) immediately before a transient
, said transient will sound post-crossfade which is what we generally desire.
 Often, given this important detail, I don’t even need to visit the crossfade
 editor view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using a vertical workflow, make sure you have the source folder selected
 before you create the source IN and OUT markers.
 You can do so by clicking on the track panel or on the item itself.
 This adds the folder number as a prefix to the source marker labels.
 The various functions will then use this label to know which folder to
 copy from.
 This is really useful if you undo the edit in order to tweak the markers
 by dragging them.
 It doesn’t matter if you then select other folders/tracks.
 In the event you use two different folders for the source IN and OUT markers,
 the functions will prefer the source IN label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The downside to this workflow when using a vertical approach is that the
 source and destination markers can get in each other’s way visually if
 the takes aren’t somewhat staggered however the process still works as
 expected.
 See below for a razor editing alternative.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multi-Project Tab S-D Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you'd like to S-D edit between various open project tabs you can set
 both the source and destination 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

project
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 markers via 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash

\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

) for source (essentially the same numbers associated with regular S-D markers).
 The markers can exist anywhere on the tab's timeline but perhaps the very
 beginning or end would be good to keep out of the way.
 The S-D editing itself then works just as for a single tab other than any
 source markers that are set are not deleted to aid quickly undoing in the
 destination tab and being ready to reapply the edit.
 The only rule when using S-D project markers is to ensure that source or
 destination markers should be paired with the corresponding source or destinati
on project marker.
 This workflow would, for example, allow you to have multiple project tabs
 (perhaps one for each symphony movement plus a final 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

destination
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 tab), allowing for both internal editing per tab but after setting the
 S-D project markers compiling the final edit in the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld

\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 tab.
 To delete all the S-D project markers press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
shift+
\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Also, in multi-tab S-D editing, when regular markers are placed, any other
 existing versions in other tabs are automatically deleted to ensure that
 only one version of the marker exists at a time across all open project
 tabs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Subsubsection
2-Point Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this operation, there are two possibilities: 1) Set one source marker
 and one destination marker.
 Make the edit with 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{5}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Any missing IN markers are set to the beginning of the timeline and any
 missing OUT markers are set to the end of the source or destination material.
 2) Set both source markers and no destination markers.
 Make the edit with 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{5}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 Here, the destination markers are set at the exact same positions on the
 timeline as the source markers.
 Obviously this operation is only useful in a vertical editing workflow
 when you can select source material from a different track group.
 The usefulness of this second option is further reduced if the takes are
 not vertically aligned and not virtually identical in tempo.
 On the other hand, it could be an incredibly quick method for editing takes
 of a hybrid classical piece that is performed to a click track or other
 recorded steady beat.

Using the ReaClassical_Insert with timestretching function 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F4}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 , you can complete a 4-point edit where the material between the source
 markers is timestretched to fit the length of time between the destination
 markers.
 This is really useful when the source material has to fit the destination
 span exactly, for example when working with visual cues.
 The timestretch algorithm used will be the one set in REAPER project settings.
 When there are multiple items in between the source markers, the function
 will glue the items together before time-stretching.
 Note that this function can also be used in multi-tab S-D editing mode
 (see above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Assembly Line Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes you don’t necessarily have a best overall take and it is desirable

\end_inset

 shortcut.
 A 3-point insert operation will occur and the destination IN marker will
 jump to the end of the pasted item, ready for the next edit.
 This means that in order to compile further sections, you now only need
 set the source markers.
 Note that this function can also be used in multi-tab S-D editing mode
 (see above).

Razor Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the potential for visual overlap of markers, I much prefer the

 It works a lot like the process shown in this Pyramix

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Pyramix also has additional source-destination marker workflows, I
 couldn’t help but feel that for professional ensembles that manage a high
 degree of tempo regularity between takes, this method can be extremely
 efficient.
 This isn’t the document to introduce REAPER razor edits as there are plenty
 of resources online if you do a simple search but here we are only concerning
 ourselves with creation of the razor area across all our pairs and spot
 mics (REAPER’s default shortcut is the rather uninspiring Alt+Right drag)
 but thankfully it can become the default editing mode by either using the
 I shortcut and right dragging or selecting the Razor edit mode on the main
 toolbar and left dragging.

Crossfade Editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you’ve made your precise edits using S/D workflow or razor editing
 (no worries if it’s a bit rough!), it’s time to check things through with
 a good listen and the help of the crossfade editor view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While REAPER includes an excellent crossfade editor, it does not reach the
 same levels as the ones in specialist classical DAWs such as Sequoia and
 Pyramix.
 This is mainly due to the inability to see the continued waveforms of the
 items beyond the crossfade they enter and likewise the previous waveforms
 of the items that exit the crossfade.
 The ability to visually align transients and then position the crossfade
 just before it is absolutely critical (and fun when you have the tools
 to do it!).
 So, beyond the standard REAPER crossfade editor what have I provided? Select
 the left-hand item of a fade, Press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and you are moved into crossfade editor mode.
 Here, the first track is given full vertical zoom, the two-lanes for overlappin
g items is enabled, colored red and green, and the fade editor toolbox appears
 (I personally position it to hover over the middle of my mixer.
 Note also that you are automatically centred on the crossfade and can use
 the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
 Press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 again and you exit that mode.
 If for some reason you accidentally close just the fade toolbox, either
 open again using action in the action list or, better still, simply close
 and re-open the fade editor using 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, now you are in the crossfade editor mode, ensuring one or both items
 are selected, hover your mouse over a blank area and press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{Z}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to automatically mirror extend the waveform view of each item.
 Essentially, it increases the overlap so you can spot and align the transient
 you want.
 My own preferred method of getting the perfect crossfade is to locate the
 transient I want on the red left item, place the edit cursor just before
 it, then drag my green right item so that the two transients align.
 Then I press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{X}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (classical crossfade) and I’m done! The crossfade happens at the location
 of the edit cursor (well, just before it as explained above).

 It is deleted automatically after playback ends.
 If you try to run the function another time before it has finished, just
 select new instance if you get a pop-up box.
 You can stack instances and on completion of the latest run, all instances
 are removed.
 Better to experience than describe but it works really well.
 You’ll also see that the edit cursor returns to the middle of the crossfade

 The mirrored position takes into consideration the overlap of the items

 Be aware that the Contents knobs will not ripple markers (but with the
 introduction of the Create CD Markers, I highly recommend not bothering
 to create any markers at this point).

Other Editing Tips

In my key map, I include all sorts of useful shortcuts to use during editing.
 As mentioned above, in vertical editing workflows, the Audition

 or Exclusive Audition 
\begin_inset ERT

 are brilliant for listening to various takes before applying a razor or

 I can shuttle between items with

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and

\end_layout

\end_inset

 for zooming out to the whole project both horizontally and vertically etc.
 There are plenty more for the mastering end of things so I encourage you
 to explore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that all regular markers and regions are ripple edited
 appropriately when using my source-destination editing functions and crossfade
 editor.
 I also introduced the ReaClassical_Lock Toggle function 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{K}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 which temporarily locks all source groups and engages ripple-all-tracks
 mode to enable you to drag destination items and simultaneously ripple
 markers and regions in the regular arrange view.
 This allows vertical source groups to retain their independence yet still
 give ripple-all-tracks behaviour which is useful for destination album
 track spacing etc.
 However, I consider this function deprecated given I strongly feel that
 the Create CD Markers function is now the ultimate way to deal with CD
 tracks/markers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mixing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
FX Plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical is shipped with various mastering-grade JSFX plugins to cover
 typical needs although obviously REAPER allows for any 3rd party plugins.
 For a list of recommended free plugins see Appendix C.
 In ReaClassical, you should add plugins to the dedicated mixer tracks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Aux & Submix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users have the ability to create aux and/or submix tracks that stay visible
 (and stay after the mixer tracks).
 To set up, simply create a single folder via Horizontal Workflow 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F7}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and/or Vertical Workflow 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F8}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 then create as many aux/submix tracks after the mixer tracks as you like
 via the Add Aux 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{@}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or Add Submix functions 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
#}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 It is important to keep the @ or # at the beginning of the track but you
 can add any name you'd like e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

@hall-verb
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

#strings
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

.
 To route, click-drag from a mixer track's routing stripes to the desired
 @ or # track.
 When using any of the ReaClassical functions such as auditioning, these
 tracks will remain visible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For # submix tracks, simply add a hyphen (-) at the end of desired track
 names in the first folder and sync via 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F7}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F8}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Now those related mixer tracks will not route directly to RCMASTER.
 As an example, say tracks 3-6 are all string section microphones and you'd
 like to sum them all to a string submix track called 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

#strings
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

.
 Just add a hyphen to the end of the names for tracks 3-6, sync and then
 create the routing to #strings via click-dragging from the routing stripes.
 This routing is maintained during 
\begin_inset ERT

 syncs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Roomtone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a live concert recording that contains audience noise in between movements
 and applause at the end of a complete piece, it is often desirable to give
 the impression of a clean recording with no audience present.
 Recorded or generated room tone then becomes very important as an alternative
 to audio fading to complete digital silence which destroys the illusion
 of listening back to a live concert.
 ReaClassical includes a dedicated room tone track for this purpose.
 This way, the auditioning tool will keep the track displayed in both track
 and mixer panels.
 Add via 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
textasciitilde}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (tilde).
 Once added, you can add clean recorded noise captured before or after the
 concert or generate endless roomtone the length of your project from a
 very small portion of clean silence from the concert itself (hint: try
 using a white noise generator into a convolver such as ReaVerb that uses
 a few seconds of clean room tone as the impulse!).
 As of ReaClassical 24.12, the Create CD Markers function automatically generates
 precise volume automation at the track level to seamlessly fade in and
 out of room tone! See the mastering section for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mastering

 Many features described here are not available in any other classical DAW.
 I hope that the

 way saves you much time and helps you look forward to the mastering phase
 of the project.
 While automatic DDP generation, automatic room tone function, and professional
 album reports are the main features here, you will probably find the revolution
ary automation mode is an extremely efficient way to add static mixer scenes
 across your production as well enjoying the ability to quickly reorder
 album tracks via a simple keyboard shortcuts.

 In addition to making the mixer tracks, busses and RCMASTER available in
 the arrange window for setting static mixer scenes via envelope points,
 it also serves to declutter by hiding any source group audio.

Given ReaClassical is built on top of REAPER, it allows for same high-quality

 Beyond the following workflow descriptions, it is recommended to read the
 relevant REAPER manual section as there are far more features than can
 be described here.
 It makes most sense to leave any automation work until the destination

 To add static mixer and FX

 Hopefully this 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

ReaClassical
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 way can make things faster and easier at the same time.
 Once multiple static mixes have been set up, you can then, of course, use
 more detailed automation via the pencil tool or riding the fader to, for
 example, temporarily bring up spot microphones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, there are also take envelopes that you can access via right-clickin
g on an item and going to 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
menu{Take > Take Volume Envelope}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This is incredibly useful for transparently reducing very short stray peaks
 versus using a limiter.
 Simply create a selection over the problematic area by left-click-dragging
 and then 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
ctrl+
\backslash
shift}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and drag up or down to just affect that portion of the envelope without
 needing to add in individual points.
 It's such a time-saver! The benefit here is that you can also see how the
 item waveform is affected in realtime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Repositioning Tracks in an Album
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two functions which help with reordering or repositioning tracks.
 First, and perhaps most useful for producing a classical album, is if you
 decide that you need to reorder one or tracks.
 Simply select the track you want to move and press either 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
ctrl+
\backslash
arrowkeyleft}
\end_layout

\end_inset

or 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
ctrl+
\backslash
arrowkeyright}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to switch with the track immediately to the left or right.
 Note that gaps are preserved too.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other situation is when you want to start with uniform gaps between
 a series of short separate pieces.
 Use the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
ctrl+Y}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shortcut and enter a value in seconds.
 Your pieces are then automatically spaced and items crossfaded are left
 intact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Loudness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of loudness, I personally aim for about -18 LUFS Integrated for
 my classical albums though it can be as high as -16 LUFS and as low as
 -20 LUFS.
 The new loudness JSFX meter in REAPER along with the normalization of loudness
 and true-peak limiting in the render dialog are priceless.
 It’s another reason I couldn’t go back to the big classical DAWs at this
 point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Metadata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Track titles are added to the individual items on the first destination
 track by double-clicking on the item or selecting and pressing 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F2}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Note that only items that start tracks should be named.
 The rest of the metadata is then added via the Create CD Markers function
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{Y}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You can add UPC/EAN and ISRC numbers as desired followed by album title,
 performer, composer and genre.
 The Markers to CUE function 
\begin_inset ERT

Creating DDP filesets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have introduced a workflow to automatically add the CD/DDP markers,regions
 and room tone automation via 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{Y}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (track and region names are pulled from item take names, markers/regions
 auto-snap to CD frames, initial 2-second pre-gap, silent roll out and album
 metadata also added!) .
 It is ‘smart’ in the sense that if there’s no take name, no marker or region
 will be created.
 In other words, press 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F2}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 with an item selected to enter track names where markers/regions need to
 be created.
 It’s perfect for classical releases where a crossfaded item is likely an
 internal source-destination edit versus a new track.
 For CD tracks that you want to have a visual CD player countdown, simply
 start the item name with an exclamation (!).
 Preferences such as CD marker offset, pregap length and album lead-out
 can be set via ReaClassical Project Preferences 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F5}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 So it’s now very quick to export a DDP set! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, you can add audio to the initial pregap (an 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

easter egg
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 track) by not giving the first item (or crossfaded items) a take name.
 The function will assume that this is supposed to be hidden and generate
 the initial pregap length accordingly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a room tone track is present in the project, the function will also generate
 precise track-level volume automation that creates perfectly-matching fades
 at points where items fade into and out of silence on the first destination
 track.
 In other words, slicing and dicing room tone audio to fill in digital silence
 is no longer necessary in ReaClassical!

Samplerate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that r8brain free has been introduced as the best quality resampler
 available in REAPER (I highly recommend double-checking that it is selected
 when resampling at render time) I feel I can do everything, including DDP
 creation, without leaving my favourite DAW.
 However, the Marker to CUE function 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

 is still useful for all sorts of things and I often create FLAC + CUE for
 album playback in my media player or WAV + CUE to easily burn a CD at home.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dither
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use either the built-in REAPER dither options or RCDither as the last plugin
 on the master chain.
 If using RCDither or any other 3rd-party dither be sure to keep the master
 fader at unity and disable all REAPER dither checkboxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Loudness & Limiting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REAPER has a fantastic rendering feature which allows the user to set a
 desired loudness and peak / true peak setting.
 For quick exports that need to meet certain targets (i.e.
 streaming) this makes things extremely efficient and is very transparent
 when not set to extreme values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dry-run Rendering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another REAPER feature that is outstanding is the dry-run render function
 which allows for very quick offline loudness and peak checks and much faster
 than using REAPER's included realtime loudness meter.
 It is therefore extremely easy to set up compressors, limiters etc in the
 project and make small adjustments based on the dry-run values and maintain
 complete control over the process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other Rendering Tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not necessarily obvious to new REAPER users are the special =START and =END
 markers (make your markers in the usual way and label them accordingly)
 that constrain the length of the project.
 Rather than rely on extended silence at the end of items or time selections,
 the =END marker is a great way to ensure you have the exact amount of lead-out
 you want at the end of the disc.
 Positioning both special markers is great way to generate files for multi-disc
 releases without having to rely on multiple projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will hopefully notice I have included various shortcuts for manually
 creating regions (single or multiple) from items and time selection (great
 for quickly generating demo snippets).
 Also worth noting is that you can still do some (or all!) of your source-destin
ation editing with your track markers in place as the S/D markers have IDs
 far higher than any classical CD would have and are automatically deleted
 after a successful edit.
 As long as you have your ripple-per-track mode engaged, all your existing
 marker placements and carefully crafted edits will remain intact.
 But, again, don’t manually create CD markers at this point as I include
 a very powerful tool to make light work of that side of mastering.

\begin_layout Subsection
Folder Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical defaults to placing media and exports into appropriately subfolders
 making project file navigation easier.
 Also, ReaClassical defaults to separate folders for automatic backups and
 autosaves.
 These settings are subject to change and can be modified by going to the
 REAPER preferences

Automatic Backups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REAPER allows for powerful and complex backup routines.
 As referenced above, ReaClassical defaults to 10 time-stamped backups and
 10 auto-saves every 15 minutes when not recording.
 Feel free to modify for your own way of working including switching to
 backups and autosaves for a number of unique days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cleaning

\begin_layout Standard
If in doubt, keep everything! Otherwise, the 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 is an excellent way to reduce the size of your projects.
 Note that when assigning a session name via the Take Counter Window, currently

Archiving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are various ways to archive classical music projects.
 First, you can access the Project Bay by 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{
\backslash
ctrl+B}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 shortcut.
 You can then ensure that all media used in the project is contained within
 the project folder itself.
 If not, you can select as many as necessary, right click and move/copy
 into the project folder.
 After this, you can simply compress the folder as a zip and store on an
 external drive.
 A further step to guaranteeing ability to open in the future is to freeze
 tracks so that plugin effects are baked in (with ability to unfreeze later
 if possible).
 Alternatively you can save a copy of the project via 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
menu{File > Save project as...}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\emph on
,
\emph default
 converting to a format like FLAC and trimming the media as you wish.
 Finally, one to look out for in the future is 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Project Archiver"

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, I don't believe it is quite ready for primetime yet and recommend
 using one of the other methods for now.

 It is advised to save your project and name your tracks before starting

 This ensures that the recorded files have usefully unique names.
 You can right-click on the window to set a take number to increment from
 and also set a session name to act as media subfolder.
 You can left-click to recalculate the track count if you have removed some
 unused files from the project path.
 The calculated upcoming take number factors in unused files in the project
 path so as to avoid any file-naming conflicts.
 You should find this to be an extremely robust take system that rivals
 Pyramix, Sequoia etc.

Notes: 
\emph default
With a single folder group (or individual tracks), the shortcut will auto-color
 and group takes from left to right.
 With a vertical workflow consisting of a destination group and multiple
 source groups, the function will auto-color top to bottom and group folder
 items left to right.
 Essentially in either setup, takes are given different colors and all items
 associated with a take grouped for editing.
 If you don't like the colors, run the function again until you are happy!
 The function also allows for takes that don't start or end exactly at the
 same time (this can happen if you receive pre-edited materials).
 The end result is if you drag one item of a take group, every other item
 will move in sync.
 NOTE: The function was designed for use after initial recording or importing
 of media but as of 24.5.3 should work at any point during editing (for example
 to import a patch recording).
 In this case, the destination group items will switch to using alternating
 colors so that you can easily see where your edits are on the timeline.
 And, as of 24.8.5, the function uses the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

Prepare Takes: Random colors
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 value from ReaClassical Preferences to use either the new color scheme
 (default, set to 0) or the old random color method (set to 1).
 A reminder that the new REAPER native grouping (when set up via Horizontal
 or Vertical Workflow functions) works for 99% of situations without Prepare
 Takes but for takes that don't start or end at quite the same point it
 is a must.

 Inbetween the destination markers is where the edit will actually happen.
 Inbetween the source markers is where the material is taken from.
 Use all four markers for 4-point editing.
 Use any combination of 3 markers for 3-point editing.
 Use either 1 source and 1 destination (more useful) or just the source
 markers for 2-point editing (less useful).
 Very important and useful to note is that the source marker labels reflect
 which source group was highlighted when the markers were placed.
 In other words, to create source markers, first select the item in the
 chosen folder track and then use the

 function via shortcut 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 and you will be asked to enter various information including UPC/ISRC (optional

 Done! Note that ISRC codes are auto-generated per track based on the numbers
 you enter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add audio to the initial pregap (easter egg track) by not giving
 the first item (or crossfaded items) a take name.
 The function will assume that this is supposed to be hidden and generate
 the initial pregap length accordingly.
 All album metadata is placed towards the end of the album inside a default
 7-second silent lead-out (so that CD players in cars don't immediately
 cycle back to the first track without a little breathing room).
 This value can be changed via the ReaClassical Project Preferences 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
keys{F5}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 .
 In addition to markers, regions are also generated for easy exporting of
 individual tracks.
 If you need a countdown into a track, simply add a ! at the start of the
 take name (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

!Allegro
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

).
 Then after running the function adjust the position as desired (it defaults
 to 3 seconds in length but this can easily be set in ReaClassical Preferences).
 It is worth repeating at this point that you should only give names to
 items that are track starts.
 If you skip an item, the function rightly assumes it is part of the previous
 track.
 Note that the markers snap to exact CD frames and if the media item start
 is in between CD frames, the function will always place the marker on the
 earlier of the two.
 By default, the function uses a 200ms offset for placement of the markers
 (as in, markers appear 200ms to the left of the media item start) but,
 again, this value can be set via ReaClassical Preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a room tone track exists in the project, the function will also generate
 volume automation to create perfect crossfades with the items on the first
 destination track.
 Slicing and dicing room tone audio to fill in digital silence is now a
 thing of the past.
 Simply add a long recorded or convolution-generated room tone audio item
 before running the function.
 The ReaClassical way of dealing with room tone is non-destructive and instant!
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I feel that once you try this CD/DDP marker generation workflow, it is difficult
 to ever go back to other ways of working.
 The key thing to think about is that the markers and room tone fade-ins
 and outs are trivially easy to recreate if you change a gap between items
 or even rearrange the order of tracks.
 Just run the function again.
 The key is the workflow: all marker generation is automatically based on
 item positioning and naming.
 Plus, all metadata and ISRC is saved into the project file so once entered
 you don't have to ever type it in again unless you need to make changes.
 Room tone volume changes are made via auto-generated volume envelope points
 that precisely map REAPER's built-in fade curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hopefully you agree that this way of working with CD/DDP layout is a game-change
r, a real time-saver and simply a better way of thinking about this portion
 of the mastering process.

Lock every source group (leaving the destination group free for editing
 in ripple-all mode)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Notes:
\emph default
 This function is now deprecated but I will leave in place for now.
 It was useful before the new 
\emph on
Create CD Markers
\emph default
 function came into being as a way to engage ripple-all mode without disturbing
 source group items, thereby allowing moving of destination material along
 with CD markers in the final stages of the mastering process.
 There is no doubt that I much prefer working with the newer function.
 The lock toggle icon on the custom toolbar has now been replaced by a mug
 to represent the 
\emph on
Create CD Markers
\emph default
 action.

 There's only a make-up gain slider as everything else is baked in (-50dB

 Use on a dedicated compressor bus and adjust the gain slider to taste (with
 the compressor signal somewhere between -15dB and -5dB lower than dry signal
 according to Katz).

 release and is on par or better than Windows.
 As a starting point, ensure that your username is set up for realtime privilege
s (step 3 in both guides) and that you set several kernel parameters to
 ensure you are running the performance governor, threadirqs and dynamic
 preempt (step 4).
 To make things even easier, consider using a dedicated audio/video distro

 I’ll let you figure that out yourself.
