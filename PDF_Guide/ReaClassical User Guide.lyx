Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align left
First up, it is important to note that if you already own REAPER then the
 world of classical editing including source-destination editing (aka 3-and-4-po
int editing), crossfade editing and more are available at no extra cost
 to you via the freely available ReaClassical system.
 There’s no need to spend any of your hard-earned money on Sequoia, Pyramix
 or SaDiE in order to make editing precise and efficient.
 As a classical engineer myself, I can say with certainty that what I am
 about to share with you covers all my recording, editing and mastering
 needs.
 Your mileage may vary and I’d love to hear from you if there are functions
 that you feel might be missing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
This Guide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This guide serves as the official manual for ReaClassical.
 The latest version is always available directly online or offline from
 within ReaClassical by using the H (for 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

help
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

) shortcut.
 The benefit of the offline version is that it is always in sync with the
 version of the tools you are using.
 The structure of the guide is designed to take the user through preliminary
 remarks, install and update procedures for both ReaClassical and REAPER
 then a detailed look at workflows from creating a project through to final
 render.
 Then follows appendices (descriptions of all the ReaClassical functions,
 keyboard shortcut guide, recommended free mastering-grade plugins, system
 tweaks for all three major OSes, and, finally, a manual install guide mainly
 for academic purposes.
 The guide closes with some thanks and closing remarks.

 plays an important role in the development of ReaClassical.
 Not only is it a place for users to suggest feature requests and point
 out bugs but also discuss more general classical music recording, mixing
 and mastering techniques.
 It also serves as something of a development blog as I not only announce
 the regular releases but also document the under-the-surface details for
 those that are interested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Ways to Contribute
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important way users can contribute to the development of ReaClassical
 is to actually use the tools! I makes me happy to know that engineers can
 make whole professional-sounding and technically accurate masters from
 ReaClassical.
 Another is to suggest features or let me know about bugs.
 You can either do this on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\begin_layout Section
Development Style
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to working on github and releasing the functions via ReaPack, I have
 the ability to push bugfixes and new features very quickly into an existing
 ReaClassical install.
 Often bugfixes happen within minutes or hours of receiving the report.
 When I dream up new features, the development often happens in rapid fashion
 over the course of a few days.
 However, now that ReaClassical has what I consider a mature feature set,
 I foresee maintenance and occasional bugfixes becoming more central to
 the process.
 This will give me more opportunity to work on this documentation, a complete
 video tutorial series etc.
 Part of development is also ensuring that ReaClassical continues to operate
 as expected with the latest REAPER versions.
 That's not to say there won't be new features appearing! As the REAPER
 devs add more new features, I will always check to see what might be useful
 for ReaClassical.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Versioning Style
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical currently uses YY.MINOR.MICRO versioning (e.g.
 24.2.1) which is a sort of hybrid between SemVer and CalVer styles.
 The short year acts as the major version with minor numbers increasing
 for new features and the micro number increasing for smaller changes such
 as bugfixes.
 At the very least the short year gives a sense of how recent the ReaClassical
 version is.
 Another popular piece of software that uses the same versioning style is

ReaClassical Workflows

\begin_layout Section
Creating & Setting Up a Project

When you start REAPER/ReaClassical from a default portable install, you'll
 see an empty project with ReaClassical project defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You shouldn't need to change any settings here.
 By default, render resampling is set to the highest quality using r8brain
 free.
 Media is saved to a 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 subfolder.
 The default recording format is 32-bit float wave files.
 Video frame rate is set to 75 to align with the number of frames per second
 for an audio CD.
 You can, of course, fill in the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

notes
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 section with a title, author and notes as desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Audio Settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These settings are operating system dependent.
 Choice of blocksize etc is also dependent on need and how modern and/or
 optimised your system is.
 For general microphone setup, device and recording settings specifically
 for classical music etc I recommend referring to one or more of the following:

 For a more detailed look at mastering (for any genre of music), I highly
 recommend

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ReaClassical Preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing F5 brings up the ReaClassical Preferences dialog.
 The first line sets the crossfade length in milliseconds for all source-destina
tion editing.
 The three remaining lines are for 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "DDP"
target "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_Description_Protocol"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 creation.
 The defaults are for a 200ms track offset (to account for older CD players
 that couldn't play audio immediately after a track search), the INDEX0
 length in seconds for when to start a CD player 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

countdown
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 display to the next track (a fun visual trick that is, of course, completely
 irrelevant for purely digital releases) and, finally, the album lead-out
 time in seconds (essentially the time on a car CD player before the disc
 returns to the beginning again).
 There will be more on these settings in subsequent sections of the manual.
 If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, I recommend a quick internet
 search! If in doubt, leave everything as defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Choice of Workflow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice between what I refer to as 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

vertical
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

horizontal
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 workflows will depend somewhat on the complexity of the project.
 For a quick editing session of, say, a choral piece or short self-standing
 orchestral piece, a horizontal approach will suffice.
 For everything else, I recommend using the vertical approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Vertical Workflow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this approach, the source and destination track groups are aligned vertically
 so that the user doesn't have to shuttle back and forth along the timeline
 for placing source-destination markers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
When Recording material:
\series default
 To begin with a vertical workflow, press F7 to set up a destination track
 group.
 Whether recording or importing, simply type in the total number of stereo
 and mono microphone inputs you need.
 I highly recommend using the first track for the main stereo pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
When importing material:
\series default
 To begin with a vertical workflow, press F8 to set up a destination track
 group and six source groups (don't worry, it's easy to add more if you
 need them!).
 Simply type in the number of tracks you need.
 I highly recommend using the first track for the main stereo pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The F8 function creates six source groups based off the destination track
 group, links the volume, panning, polarity, mute, automation trim and hides
 everything in the mixer save for the first folder group.
 In other words, you can simultaneously control volume, panning, polarity
 and automation across all takes.
 It also sets up media item and razor editing grouped by folder.
 If you need more than the six source groups, simply create them on the
 fly with the 
\backslash
 shortcut.
 but note that using F9 (Classical Take Record) creates a new source group
 as needed after ending recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical scenario: You have vertically recorded, or vertically prepared,
 multiple takes of a concerto movement with 10 channels.
 You realise halfway through editing that you want the soloist’s microphone
 to be brought up in volume a little and also panned slightly more to the
 right to match the position in the main stereo pair.
 Under normal circumstances moving one pan knob or fader would only affect
 that one group's channel.
 The ideal situation would be that changing a value on one channel would
 affect every other take in the same way, making comparing source material
 uniform in volume and panning.
 With the ReaClassical vertical workflow approach, this becomes a reality
 automatically!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Horizontal Workflow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this approach, there is a single track or single group of tracks with
 the source and destination material laid out from left to right.
 As mentioned above, for shorter pieces of music this is often a perfectly
 acceptable approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin a horizontal workflow, press F7 to set up a track group.
 Whether recording or importing, simply type in the number of tracks or
 microphone inputs you need.
 I highly recommend using the first track for the main stereo pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to convert to a vertical workflow, simply press F8 to create
 six linked destination groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Recording
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you have decided on a workflow, we can set up the tracks for recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setting Inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple ways to set recording inputs on REAPER.
 First is to click on the input at the top of the mixer channel.
 Second, you can left-click on the meter part of the track panel.
 Third, you can press Alt+R to open the routing matrix.
 Once you have set the inputs for the source group, simply press F8 to sync
 these settings to all destination groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Headroom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, I refer you to the books on classical music production but in general
 I suggest aiming for around -12dB peaks on the meters.
 24-bit recording allows for a lot of headroom so there's no need to push
 close to 0dB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Classical Recording
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
F9 begins 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

classical
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

 recording mode for whatever parent track is selected.
 You'll notice that the mixer intelligently selects the affected tracks
 and all tracks in the group are armed begin recording.
 To stop, press F9 again.
 This also automatically moves to, solos and arms the next available group.
 ReaClassical will automatically create new groups as required.
 To manually add more destination groups when not recording, press 
\backslash
 (backslash).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
General Recording
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To record for a horizontal workflow or more generally (say a separate single
 mono narration track or similar), use the built-in REAPER record function
 arm the track(s) and then either press Ctrl+R or use the red record button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Importing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you acting solely as editor and have the audio ready to import into ReaClassi
cal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Importing Media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Set up the horizontal or vertical workflow as desired.
 Then either drag the audio into the REAPER window or select 
\emph on
Insert > Media file...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For classical music purposes, you can then choose whether to insert in the
 same time position on separate tracks or sequentially on a single track.
 For recordings with multiple takes using separate files, I recommend inserting/
dragged one take at a time onto separate tracks on either the source group
 or first destination group.
 Once everything is imported you can then drag sets of tracks to the destination
 groups as desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-Channel Audio Import
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use a portable recorder such as a MixPre, you might have a multi-channel
 combined file.
 ReaClassical includes a special function for converting these into a stereo
 pair + mono track set.
 Simply select one or more multi-channel sets and press F10.
 Answer yes to the prompt that appears if the first two channels should
 be treated as stereo interleaved (i.e.
 they represent your main pair).
 Depending on the choice made, the number of tracks in the folder will adjust
 accordingly.
 If the user selects ‘no’ to keep all tracks mono, the folder track is left
 empty so that the Prepare Takes (T) script is able to create a muted guide
 track (more on this later!).
 It's important to note is that to use the Explode multi-channel item script
 you should import your multi-channel items into one folder track lined
 up horizontally before running the script.
 You can then drag to source groups afterwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Navigating a Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to built-in REAPER functions, ReaClassical uses a series of
 shortcuts to help you easily navigate your classical project.
 Important: I always make some dedicated time post-recording to get a lay
 of the land, tidy up the digital notes I took during the session and perform
 a backup on an external drive as soon as possible.

\begin_layout Standard
Use ` (backtick) to see the whole project horizontally and/or Ctrl+` to
 see everything vertically.
 I chose to separate these functions because one of the axes (often the
 vertical) is set exactly how you need for editing and it would be a pain
 to have the axis reset.
 You can also go to the start and end of the project by pressing the Home
 or End key.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Items & Markers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can easily shuffle back and forth between items and markers by using
 the Q and W keys.
 You can move between markers by using the , and .
 keys.
 The TAB key moves to a selected item's highest peak value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parents & Children
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical can hide or show children of track groups.
 This means that editing multi-track classical music can be as easy as editing
 a stereo track.
 When takes have been prepared (see below), all edits are synchronised.
 To show hidden children select the parent track and press D (for 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

display
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

).
 To hide, select the parent track and press E (for 
\begin_inset Quotes bld

).
 The other benefit is that a whole set of takes can be displayed vertically
 in the main editing window without too much effort.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Peaks Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To adjust the visual zoom of wave peaks, use Ctrl+Up arrow and Ctrl+Down
 arrow.
 This is purely visual and allows for easier editing of quieter sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ReaClassical Toolbar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I designed ReaClassical to be used efficiently with keyboard shortcuts,
 there is a custom toolbar for those that prefer it.
 However I do highly recommend learning the key strokes as you will find
 your editing speeds improve dramatically.

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction to Editing Workflows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have recorded or imported your classical music audio, you are ready
 to start editing the raw material! Here we talk about the meat and potatoes
 of the classical editing workflows.
 Workflows—plural—because I have included different approaches to suit as
 many tastes as possible within the confines of the REAPER application.
 I will explain each in detail after this brief introduction.
 As described previously, you have multiple ways of proceeding.
 First you can have all your takes lined up in a row horizontally and you
 place your source in and out markers, destination in and out markers then
 press a keyboard shortcut to achieve your 3 or 4-point edit.
 The second way is to set up your takes vertically and then either use the
 same marker system to make your edits or use razor edits (my preferred
 method when working vertically).
 Whichever option you choose, you will then end up in the crossfade editor
 view which uses a custom two-lane view with classical crossfade script
 to make precise edits really easy in REAPER.
 I don’t often use the fade editor dialog that comes with REAPER even though
 I make it appear as part of the script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Marking Edits on your Scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is best done using a physical, photocopied score by the conductor or
 lead musician.
 I advocate for a “T” system where a large T is inserted into the score
 at the intended edit point.
 Either side of the T stem, and under the crossbar, the outgoing and incoming
 take numbers are written.
 A wavy crossbar indicates some leeway for where the edit point can be placed.
 Further notes can be attached underneath the T such as directions for tightenin
g the gap etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preparing Takes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whether working horizontally or vertically, you can use the Prepare Takes
 function.
 It is intelligent enough to figure out which workflow you are using.
 Just press the shortcut T (for 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

Takes
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

).
 Super simple! Every set of items comprising a take has changed colour,
 is now grouped.
 In addition, source and destination groups are linked or (re-linked) for
 various types of editing and imported/recorded take names removed if desired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For horizontally laid-out takes, each complete take is coloured with a different
 random colour.
 For vertically laid-out takes, each folder’s items are given a different
 random colour.
 This way, however you work, it’s easy to see where edits have come from.
 If you imported or recorded all your files in child tracks, the script
 will additionally copy all items from each first child track into the folder
 track and mute them to act as a visual guide track.
 You will receive a pop-up message if this is the case.
 Note that if there are existing item overlaps and/or fades in the first
 track, Prepare Takes will be mainly disabled and only allow you to remove
 take names (in preparation for creation of CD markers).
 This is a safety feature given grouping already crossfaded items can lead
 to unexpected editing results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Auditioning Takes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For horizontal editing, you can use the usual transport shortcuts (spacebar
 to start and stop playback, for example).
 For vertical (and horizontal) editing, it is highly recommended to use
 the Audition (A) script to quickly solo only the folder (or track) you
 are interested in hearing.
 Note that similar to the *Classical Take Record* function, the tracks shown
 in the mixer are filtered based on what is being auditioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Source-Destination Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You set your in-out points using special coloured labelled markers I created
 with shortcuts 1 and 2 (Destination) and 3 and 4 (Source).
 Simply press the shortcut 5 to make the 3 or 4-point edit.
 You’ll also notice that because you prepared the various takes with colours
 (and grouping), it is really easy to see which takes compose your final
 edited tracks.
 It’s worth pointing out that my S/D and classical crossfade scripts place
 the crossfade immediately before the entry and exit points of the pasted
 audio.
 The crossfade length and other values can be set on a per-project basis
 via ReaClassical Preferences (F5).
 In practice this means that if you visually set a marker (or edit cursor
 in the case of the classical crossfade function) immediately before a transient
, said transient will sound post-crossfade which is what we generally desire.
 Often, given this important detail, I don’t even need to visit the crossfade
 editor view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using a vertical workflow, make sure you have the source folder selected
 before you create the source IN and OUT markers.
 You can do so by clicking on the track panel or on the item itself.
 This adds the folder number as a prefix to the source marker labels.
 The various functions will then use this label to know which folder to
 copy from.
 This is really useful if you undo the edit in order to tweak the markers
 by dragging them.
 It doesn’t matter if you then select other folders/tracks.
 In the event you use two different folders for the source IN and OUT markers,
 the functions will prefer the source IN label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can complete 3-point editing either using “insert” or “replace” methods
 with just the destination IN marker set (and both source markers!).
 “Insert” 3-point edits ripple pastes the source material at the destination
 IN marker and “Replace” 3-point edits replaces the destination material
 with the length of the material between the two source markers.
 As usual, short equal-power crossfades are created at all edit points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To choose between “insert” or “replace” 3-point edits, toggle the ReaClassical_3
-point edit replace.lua script to ON for “replace” and OFF “insert”.
 Even better: use the custom classical toolbar as described above or F3
 shortcut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The downside to this workflow when using a vertical approach is that the
 source and destination markers can get in each other’s way visually if
 the takes aren’t somewhat staggered however the process still works as
 expected.
 See below for a razor editing alternative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other SD Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the *ReaClassical_Insert with timestretching* script (F4), you can
 complete a 4-point edit where the material between the source markers is
 timestretched to fit the length of time between the destination markers.
 This is really useful when the source material has to fit the destination
 span exactly, for example when working with visual cues.
 The timestretch algorithm used will be the one set in REAPER project settings.
 When there are multiple items in between the source markers, the function
 will glue the items together before time-stretching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes you don’t necessarily have a best overall take and it is desirable
 to build the perfect performance linearly, section by section, measure
 by measure.
 In this case, use a 3-point edit (most likely you want it set to “insert”
 mode).
 A standard 3-point insert edit will happen and the destination IN marker
 will jump to the end of the pasted item, ready for the next edit.
 This means that in order to compile further sections, you now only need
 set the source markers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While perhaps not used as often as 3- and 4-point edits, I have created
 two scripts for deletion of material.
 Delete & Ripple (Backspace) will delete the material between source IN
 and OUT markers and ripple material to the right backwards with a short
 crossfade.
 Delete Silence (Ctrl+Backspace) will also delete but maintain the silence
 without rippling backwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Razor Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the potential for visual overlap of markers, I much prefer the
 REAPER razor edit functionality for vertical take work.
 It works a lot like the process shown in this Pyramix 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "video"
target "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQXwnvITQCQ"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Pyramix also has additional source-destination marker workflows, I
 couldn’t help but feel that for professional ensembles that manage a high
 degree of tempo regularity between takes, this method can be extremely
 efficient.
 This isn’t the document to introduce REAPER razor edits as there are plenty
 of resources online if you do a simple search but here we are only concerning
 ourselves with creation of the razor area across all our pairs and spot
 mics (REAPER’s default shortcut is the rather uninspiring Alt+Right drag)
 but thankfully it can become the default editing mode by running either
 running the I shortcut or selecting the Razor edit mode on the main toolbar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Crossfade Editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you’ve made your precise edits using S/D workflow or razor editing
 (no worries if it’s a bit rough!), it’s time to check things through with
 a good listen and the help of the crossfade editor view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While REAPER includes an excellent crossfade editor, it does not reach the
 same levels as the ones in specialist classical DAWs such as Sequoia and
 Pyramix.
 This is mainly due to the inability to see the continued waveforms of the
 items beyond the crossfade they enter and likewise the previous waveforms
 of the items that exit the crossfade.
 The ability to visually align transients and then position the crossfade
 just before it is absolutely critical (and fun when you have the tools
 to do it!).
 So, beyond the standard REAPER crossfade editor what have I provided? Select
 the left-hand item of a fade, Press F and you are moved into crossfade
 editor mode.
 Here, the first track is given full vertical zoom, the two-lanes for overlappin
g items is enabled, colored red and green, and the fade editor toolbox appears
 (I personally position it to hover over the middle of my mixer.
 Note also that you are automatically centred on the crossfade and can use
 the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
 Press F again and you exit that mode.
 If for some reason you accidentally close just the fade toolbox, either
 open again using action in the action list or, better still, simply close
 and re-open the fade editor using the F shortcut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, now you are in the crossfade editor mode, ensuring one or both items
 are selected, hover your mouse over a blank area and press Z to automatically
 mirror extend the waveform view of each item.
 Essentially, it increases the overlap so you can spot and align the transient
 you want.
 My own preferred method of getting the perfect crossfade is to locate the
 transient I want on the red left item, place the edit cursor just before
 it, then drag my green right item so that the two transients align.
 Then I press X (classical crossfade) and I’m done! The crossfade happens
 at the location of the edit cursor (well, just before it as explained above).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I love this method so much that I don’t miss Sequoia or Pyramix any more.
 Here it is in ordered list form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Increase overlap (by hovering mouse in blank area and pressing Z shortcut)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find transient in red left item that you want be edit point
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Place edit cursor just before it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Drag green right item to align transients (this automatically ripples all
 items, markers and regions)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Press X (classical crossfade)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reality, this process can be just a few seconds to achieve the perfect
 edit.
 In the unlikely event you need to undo, either use the standard Ctrl+Z
 combination or simply extend the overlapping item edges again then create
 a new classical crossfade.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While you could use the auditioning tools in the dialog, I have created
 something I find quicker and more useful.
 While the two items involved in the crossfade are selected, try the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Hover over left item / press A to solo audition the left item from mouse
 cursor to end of item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Hover over right item / press A to solo audition the right item from start
 of item to mouse cursor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Hover in blank space on left item side / press A to solo audition the crossfade
 from mouse cursor to mirrored position on the other side of the crossfade
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Hover in blank space on right item side / press A to solo audition the crossfade
 from mirrored position other side to the mouse cursor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you’ll see, the playback stops using a special marker with *!1016* as
 the label which is executed as a stop command.
 It is deleted automatically after playback ends.
 If you try to run the script another time before it has finished, just
 select new instance if you get a pop-up box.
 You can stack instances and on completion of the latest run, all instances
 are removed.
 Better to experience than describe but it works really well.
 You’ll also see that the edit cursor returns to the middle of the crossfade
 to aid in mouse scroll zooming keeping the crossfade centred.
 The mirrored position takes into consideration the overlap of the items
 so you can have a complicated set of fades and still get an exact mirrored
 stopping point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can shuttle between crossfades using the Q and W shortcuts.
 Do 
\series bold
NOT
\series default
 use the built-in Previous Next buttons on the standard fade dialog box!
 However, there is still a benefit of having the fade editor dialog in view.
 You can also tweak the fade using the knobs if you prefer.
 Center, Start, End and Length knobs are particularly useful here to maintain
 symmetry.
 Be aware that the Contents knobs will not ripple markers (but with the
 introduction of the Create CD Markers, I highly recommend not bothering
 to create any markers at this point).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other Editing Tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my key map, I include all sorts of useful shortcuts to use during editing.
 As mentioned above, in vertical editing workflows, the Audition (via shortcut
 A) is brilliant for listening to various takes before applying a razor
 or S/D edit.
 I can shuttle between items with Q and W (the same keys perform a more
 advanced role when in crossfade editor mode), shuttle between markers with
 , and .
 (the same keys with 
\backslash
< and 
\backslash
> on them on my UK keyboard), S for splitting a long recorded session into
 takes, ‘ (back tick) and Ctrl+‘ for zooming out to the whole project both
 horizontally and vertically etc.
 There are plenty more for the mastering end of things so I encourage you
 to explore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that all regular markers and regions are ripple edited
 appropriately when using my source-destination editing functions and crossfade
 editor.
 I also introduced the *ReaClassical_Lock Toggle* script (K) which temporarily
 locks all source groups and engages ripple-all-tracks mode to enable you
 to drag destination items and simultaneously ripple markers and regions
 in the regular arrange view.
 This allows vertical source groups to retain their independence yet still
 give ripple-all-tracks behaviour which is useful for destination album
 track spacing etc.
 However, I consider this script deprecated given I strongly feel that the
 Create CD Markers script is now the ultimate way to deal with CD tracks/markers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mixing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
FX Plugins
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ReaClassical is shipped with various mastering-grade JSFX plugins to cover
 typical needs although obviously REAPER allows for any 3rd party plugins.
 For a list of recommended free plugins see the Appendix.
 For the purposes of the ReaClassical manual, you should add plugins to
 the destination group tracks and then press F8 to sync across all source
 groups.
 Most often my editing is done with no plugins enabled so that I can hear
 all the detail clearly.
 In my case, plugins are not generally added until the 
\begin_inset Quotes bld

 stage.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Aux & Submix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of ReaClassical v23.19, users have the ability to create aux and submix
 tracks that stay visible (and stay after the source groups).
 To set up, simply create a single folder (F7) and/or Create Source Groups
 (F8) then create as many aux/submix tracks after the source groups as you
 like via the *Add Aux or submix* script.
 If adding manually, be sure to prefix the track which an ampersand (@).
 When using any of the scripts that use intelligent mixer view (Audition,
 Create Source Groups (creating source groups from a single folder or syncing
 fx and routing), Classical Take Record, Duplicate Folder) these tracks
 will stay visible.
 Plus, any routing from the destination parent or child tracks to these
 tracks will be honored when syncing the fx and routing!

Mastering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has the potential to be a long section but I don’t want it to detract
 from the main event: the S/D or razor editing workflows.
 A few pointers are in order though.
 In order to have CD markers that snap to CD frames, now is a great time
 to enable snapping (to frame) if adding them manually.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, of course, you can now quickly generate separate files via rendering
 all project regions or selected regions using a wildcard formula such as
 *$regionnumber - $region*.
 I include various useful presets in the render dialog.
 For those who insist on the absolute best resampling the world has to offer,
 export your WAV+CUE at highest resolution at 32-bit float and use a program
 like Saracon or FinalCD to get down to 44.1k/16-bit before generating the
 rest of your files in EZ CD Audio Converter (Windows), Fre:ac (all platforms)
 or similar[^8].
 Alternatively, you can bring a long converted 44.1/32-bit float WAV back
 into a cloned project not forgetting to change the sample rate of the project
 to match.
 A lot of engineers use standard TPDF dither but you can always bring your
 favourite 3rd-party plugin to the party (as long as it is the final plugin
 on your master chain and your master fader remains at unity).
 I include a large number of world-class airwindows dither options in my
 other large jsfx collection available via my [airwindows JSFX ports]

Loudness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of loudness, I personally aim for about -18 LUFS Integrated for
 my classical albums though it can be as high as -16 LUFS and as low as
 -20 LUFS.
 The new loudness JSFX meter in REAPER along with the normalization of loudness
 and true-peak limiting in the render dialog are priceless.
 It’s another reason I couldn’t go back to the big classical DAWs at this
 point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Metadata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Creating DDP filesets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have introduced a workflow to automatically add the CD/DDP markers and
 regions via Y shortcut (track and region names are pulled from item take
 names, markers/regions auto-snap to CD frames, initial 2-second pre-gap,
 silent roll out and album metadata also added!) .
 It is ‘smart’ in the sense that if there’s no take name, no marker or region
 will be created.
 In other words, press F2 with an item selected to enter track names where
 markers/regions need to be created.
 It’s perfect for classical releases where a crossfaded item is likely an
 internal source-destination edit versus a new track.
 Preferences such as CD marker offset, pregap and album lead-out can be
 set via ReaClassical Project Preferences (F5).
 So it’s now very quick to export a DDP set! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Creating CUE Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A CUE file can be generated via the shortcut C (to need create a time selection).
 The high-resolution audio portion can be generated separately in the render
 dialog via the preset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
BIN+CUE set

\begin_layout Standard
Create a BIN/CUE pair (either select

\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

use only # markers
\begin_inset Quotes brd

 and render by time selection if you don’t want the first pregap as actual
 silence at the start of track 1).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Album Reports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using the C shortcut, ReaClassical also generates both a plaintext
 and HTML album report in the project folder including details such as pre-gaps,
 track title, start time, track length, UPC/EAN and ISRC (if present), total
 running time etc.
 This is a fantastic and automatic way to send information to clients or
 a duplication/replication factory.

Now that r8brain free has been introduced as the best quality resampler
 available in REAPER (I highly recommend double-checking that it is selected
 when resampling at render time) I feel I can do everything, including DDP[^9]
 creation, without leaving my favourite DAW.
 However, the Marker to CUE function (C) is still useful for all sorts of
 things and I often create FLAC + CUE for album playback in my media player
 or WAV + CUE to easily burn a CD at home.

\begin_layout Subsection
Other Rendering Tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not necessarily obvious to new REAPER users are the special =START and =END
 markers (make your markers in the usual way and label them accordingly)
 that constrain the length of the project.
 Rather than rely on extended silence at the end of items or time selections,
 the =END marker is a great way to ensure you have the exact amount of lead-out
 you want at the end of the disc.
 Positioning both special markers is great way to generate files for multi-disc
 releases without having to rely on multiple projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will hopefully notice I have included various shortcuts for manually
 creating regions (single or multiple) from items and time selection (great
 for quickly generating demo snippets).
 Also worth noting is that you can still do some (or all!) of your source-destin
ation editing with your track markers in place as the S/D markers have IDs
 far higher than any classical CD would have and are automatically deleted
 after a successful edit.
 As long as you have your ripple-per-track mode engaged, all your existing
 marker placements and carefully crafted edits will remain intact.
 But, again, don’t manually create CD markers at this point as I include
 a very powerful tool to make light work of that side of mastering.

 It’s a very useful tool to have docked at the bottom of the screen.

 folder group (for example, created with F7 shortcut) and, for in the middle
 of editing, 3) to (re)create track grouping and to sync routing/fx between
 destination (the top folder and its children) and source groups.
 Note that for 3), all folders must contain the same number of tracks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Notes: 
\emph default
Whether you start with an empty project or use an existing folder group
 or groups, the end result will be the same.
 Folders and tracks will be grouped according to pan, mute, editing, phase,
 trim and fader.
 So, for example, the second track of each group will all respond to a fader
 movement.
 This is essential for being able to audition different source groups with
 the same settings.
 Note also that running the script engages an intelligent mixer view where
 only the soloed group is shown in the mixer.
 You can see this in action by using the Audition (A) script which auditions
 audio at the mouse cursor.
 Watch as the mixer view changes which tracks are visible.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Notes: 
\emph default
With a single folder group (or individual tracks), the shortcut will auto-color
 and group takes from left to right.
 With a vertical workflow consisting of a destination group and multiple
 source groups, the script will auto-color top to bottom and group folder
 items left to right.
 Essentially in either setup, takes are given different colors and all items
 associated with a take grouped for editing.
 If you don't like the colors, run the script again until you are happy!
 The script also allows for takes that don't start or end exactly at the
 same time (this can happen if you receive pre-edited materials).
 The end result is if you drag one item of a take group, every other item
 will move in sync.
 NOTE: After you have started making S-D edits, the script will no longer
 offer to group or colour items due to potentially unexpected editing behaviour.
 The script was designed for use after initial recording or importing of
 media only.
 It will still offer to delete any existing take names after a user-friendly
 message.
 A reminder that the new REAPER native grouping (when set up via Create
 Folder or Create Source Groups sripts) works for 99% of situations without
 Prepare Takes but for takes that don't start or end at quite the same point
 it is a must.

 Very important and useful to note is that the source marker labels reflect
 which source group was highlighted when the markers were placed.
 In other words, to create source markers, first select the item in the
 chosen folder track and then use the 3 & 4 shortcuts.
 This means that when the actual edit is made (using shortcut 5) it doesn't

 When using 3 markers, the destination IN marker is retained and moved to
 the end of the edit so you can do assembly-style editing with ease (with
 3-point mode set to

 to the mirrored location on the other side of the edit.
 Note how easy it is to quickly set an audition length! Or, hover the mouse

 Hover and press A on the outgoing item to only hear the material out of
 the fade.

 including UPC/ISRC (optional) and CD metadata.
 Done! Note that ISRC codes are auto-generated per track based on the numbers
 you enter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add audio to the initial pregap (easter egg track) by not giving
 the first item (or crossfaded items) a take name.
 The script will assume that this is supposed to be hidden and generate
 the initial pregap length accordingly.
 All album metadata is placed towards the end of the album inside a default
 7-second silent lead-out (so that CD players in cars don't immediately
 cycle back to the first track without a little breathing room).
 This value can be changed via the ReaClassical Project Preferences (F5).
 In addition to markers, regions are also generated for easy exporting of
 individual tracks.
 If you need a countdown into a track, simply add a ! at the start of the
 take name (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes bld
\end_inset

!Allegro
\begin_inset Quotes brd
\end_inset

).
 Then after running the script adjust the position as desired (it defaults
 to 3 seconds in length but this can easily be set in ReaClassical Preferences).
 It is worth repeating at this point that you should only give names to
 items that are track starts.
 If you skip an item, the script rightly assumes it is part of the previous
 track.
 Note that the markers snap to exact CD frames and if the media item start
 is in between CD frames, the script will always place the marker on the
 earlier of the two.
 By default, the script uses a 200ms offset for placement of the markers
 (as in, markers appear 200ms to the left of the media item start) but,
 again, this value can be set via ReaClassical Preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I feel that once you try this CD/DDP marker generation workflow, it is difficult
 to ever go back to other ways of working.
 The key thing to think about is that the markers are trivially easy to
 recreate if you change a gap between items or even rearrange the order
 of tracks.
 Just run the script again.
 The key is the workflow: all marker generation is automatically based on
 item positioning and naming.
 Plus, all metadata and ISRC is saved into the project file so once entered
 you don't have to ever type it in again unless you need to make changes.
 
\end_layout

 As a starting point, ensure that your username is set up for realtime privilege
