=== Importing Audio

Read this section if you or someone else recorded using a different DAW or portable recorder.

Either drag the audio into the REAPER window or select menu:Insert[Media file...].

For classical music editing purposes outside of the full ReaClassical ecosystem, you should choose a _horizontal_ approach by inserting all the takes of a particular channel sequentially on its own track. It makes sense to have the main stereo pair(s) at the top of the project followed by any section pairs and individual spots.
