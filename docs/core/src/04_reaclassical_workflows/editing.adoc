=== Ready…Steady…Go!

_Listed keyboard shortcuts are suggestions based on the full ReaClassical key map._

1. Set destination IN and OUT markers (kbd:[1] and kbd:[2])
2. Set source IN and OUT markers (kbd:[3] and kbd:[4])
3. Run the S-D Edit function (kbd:[5]) to make the source-destination edit (2-, 3- or 4-point edit depending on how many markers you set), or make a time-stretched S-D edit (kbd:[F4]) (requires all 4 markers), or if only using destination IN marker and both source markers, an "assembly" or 3-point "insert" edit (kbd:[F3])
4. To finesse the edit, open the REAPER crossfade editor (kbd:[F])

=== Multi-Project Tab S-D Editing

If you'd like to S-D edit between various open project tabs you can set both the source and destination _project_ markers. The markers can exist anywhere on the tab's timeline but perhaps the very beginning or end would be good to keep them out of the way. The S-D editing itself then works just as for a single tab other than any source markers that are set are not deleted to aid quickly undoing in the destination tab and being ready to reapply the edit. The only rule when using S-D project markers is to ensure that source or destination markers should be paired with the corresponding source or destination project marker. This workflow would, for example, allow you to have multiple project tabs (perhaps one for each symphony movement plus a final _destination_ tab), allowing for both internal editing per tab but after setting the S-D project markers compiling the final edit in the _destination_ tab. To delete all the S-D project markers run the Delete S-D Project Markers function. Also, in multi-tab S-D editing, when regular markers are placed, any other existing versions in other tabs are automatically deleted to ensure that only one version of the marker exists at a time across all open project tabs.

=== Further Source-Destination Insights

==== 4-Point Editing

For this operation, set all four markers. Make the edit with the regular ReaClassical Core S-D edit function. This is the most useful edit when dealing with classical music or other acoustic music performed without a metronome.

==== 3-Point Editing

For this operation, set any combination of three markers. Again, run the regular ReaClassical Core S-D edit function. The missing marker is placed according to the distance set by the existing complete pair.

==== 2-Point Editing

For this operation, there are two possibilities: 1) Set one source marker and one destination marker. Make the edit with the regular ReaClassical Core S-D edit function. Any missing IN markers are set to the beginning of the timeline and any missing OUT markers are set to the end of the source or destination material. 2) Set both source markers and no destination markers. Make the edit with . Here, the destination markers are set at the exact same positions on the timeline as the source markers. Obviously this operation is only useful in a vertical editing workflow when you can select source material from a different track group. The usefulness of this second option is further reduced if the takes are not vertically aligned and not virtually identical in tempo. On the other hand, it could be an incredibly quick method for editing takes of a hybrid classical piece that is performed to a click track or other recorded steady beat.

==== Insert with Time-Stretching

Using the ReaClassical Core_Insert with time-stretching function, you can complete a 4-point edit where the material between the source markers is time-stretched to fit the length of time between the destination markers. This is really useful when the source material has to fit the destination span exactly, for example when working with visual cues. The time-stretch algorithm used will be the one set in REAPER project settings. When there are multiple items in between the source markers, the function will glue the items together before time-stretching. Note that this function can also be used in multi-tab S-D editing mode (see above).

==== 3-point Insert "Assembly Line" Editing

Sometimes you don't necessarily have a best overall take and it is desirable to build the perfect performance linearly, section by section, measure by measure. In this case, set the destination IN markerand set both source markers. Run the ReaClassical_Core 3-point Insert Edit function. A 3-point insert operation will occur and the destination IN marker will jump to the end of the pasted item, ready for the next edit. This means that in order to compile further sections, you now only need set the source markers. If you accidentally move the location of the destination IN marker in the middle of assembly line editing, the function will let you know and offer to move the marker back to the right edge of the latest item in the edit. This will even allow you to do some regular 3- or 4-point editing earlier in the sequence before continuing with the assembly line edits. Just place the destination IN marker anywhere in the project and answer btn:[No] when the message box appears. Note that this function can also be used in multi-tab S-D editing mode (see above).

==== Delete / Delete with Ripple

While perhaps not used as often as 3- and 4-point edits, I have created two functions for deletion of material. Delete & Ripple will delete the material between source IN and OUT markers and ripple material to the right backwards with a short crossfade (kbd:[backspace]). Delete Leaving Silence will also delete but maintain the silence without rippling backwards (kbd:[ctrl+backspace]).

==== Delete S-D markers

Delete all regular S-D markers!

=== Crossfade Editor

Now that you've made your precise edits using S/D workflow or razor editing (no worries if it's a bit rough!), it's time to check things through with the help of the crossfade editor view.

Since v7.40, REAPER includes an excellent professional two-lane crossfade editor similar in nature to the specialist classical DAWs such as Sequoia and Pyramix. With the improved crossfade editor, users can see the continued "ghost" waveforms of the items beyond the crossfade they enter and likewise the previous waveforms of the items that exit the crossfade. The ability to visually align transients and then position the crossfade just before it is absolutely critical (and fun when you have the tools to do it!). Select the right-hand item of a fade, use whatever you have set up as the REAPER crossfade editor shortcut (or via menu:Edit[Crossfade Editor]) and the crossfade window is opened. Note also that you are automatically centered on the crossfade and can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Press the same keyboard shortcut to exit the window.

So, now you are in the crossfade editor mode, my own preferred method of getting the perfect crossfade is to move the transient I want on the left (upper) item to just after the crossfade by dragging on the ghost waveform. Then I drag the "ghost" waveform of my right (lower) item so that the two transients align. That's it! Drag on the active part of the waveform to also move the location of the crossfade. You can just move or resize the crossfade by hovering directly over the lower portion of the crossfade and dragging either the edge or the shaded rectangle.

In reality, this process can be just a few seconds to achieve the perfect edit. To ensure that previous xfades are unaffected, make sure that _Lock left-hand start_ is checked:
