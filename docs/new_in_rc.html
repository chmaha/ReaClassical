<h1 id="new-in-reaclassical-26">New in ReaClassical 26</h1>
<h2 id="long-term-support-release">Long-Term Support Release</h2>
<p>ReaClassical 26 is what you might call a “long-term support” release.
On official release, there will be no new features for a year. This
means there is no real need for a complicated update mechanism. In the
event of bugfixes, you can run shift+U as before but it will simply
update the functions without touching keymaps and other settings.</p>
<h2 id="remove-almost-all-sws-dependencies">Remove almost all SWS
dependencies</h2>
<p>Most of the dependency on SWS has been removed from key ReaClassical
functions. Only a few necessary ones remain.</p>
<h2 id="artwork">2026 artwork</h2>
<p>Lots of creative options here but I have decided to go with a blue
sky style modified from
https://pixabay.com/illustrations/pink-orange-peach-scrapbook-design-794507/.
Simple and classy.</p>
<h2
id="more-xfade-editor-actions-including-top-and-bottom-lane-auditioning">More
xfade editor actions (including top and bottom lane auditioning)</h2>
<p>When xfade editor is open, you can play just the top lane via E and
bottom via C. A plays all. S plays just the left, and D plays just the
right. Add shift modifier for A, S or D for variable playrate.</p>
<h2 id="smart-import-audio">Smart import audio</h2>
<p>Bring your audio into the media subfolder and run the function to
smartly import the audio matching track names, take number order and
optional session name by folder or by adding generic named markers.</p>
<h2 id="mission-control">Mission Control</h2>
<p>Press C to open a dialog window to rename tracks, add track to all
folders, delete tracks, reorder tracks, set inputs (automatically or
manually), adjust pan/volume, set routing, add “special” tracks etc.
Automatically opens when setting up a new project via Ctrl+N. This is
the official way to do any and all track manipulation and a gateway to
all sorts of other ReaClassical functions.</p>
<h2 id="source-audition-marker-system">Source audition marker
system</h2>
<p>Press the source audition button in Mission Control or Z to enter
source audition marker mode. Use the mouse to set razor selections and
press Z again to set some source audition markers. Use the dedicated
source audition marker manager to audition, add ranking, type notes and
delete marker pairs. You can re-order the table by timeline, marker name
or ranking. Once happy, click on one of the convert icons to convert
those markers to a real source IN/OUT pair. You can also delete all
markers at once and abandon the mode by clicking the dedicated
button.</p>
<h2 id="remove-empty-items-before-prepare-takes">Remove empty items
before prepare takes</h2>
<p>Automatically happens as part of pressing T.</p>
<h2 id="live-bounce-track">Live bounce track</h2>
<p>A new option when adding special tracks via Mission Control.
Automatically armed and records the live output from RCMASTER.</p>
<h2 id="remove-all-item-fades">Remove all item fades</h2>
<p>Shift+F to remove start and end fades from items. Ignores crossfades.
Useful when you have recorded in 4GB chunks or similar and you need to
adjoin after import to prevent short dips in the sound.</p>
<h2 id="force-prepare-take-run-before-first-s-d-edit">Force prepare take
run before first S-D edit</h2>
<p>Just so everyone starts editing with the most robust item grouping
(better than vanilla REAPER!). Press T to prepare takes before trying to
do any S-D edit.</p>
<h2
id="auto-add-generic-album-metadata-by-splitting-final-item-or-using-last-unnamed-item">Auto
add generic album metadata by splitting final item (or using last
unnamed item)</h2>
<p>When you run Y to create CD markers, the function will automatically
add some generic album metadata to an unnamed item in your album or
failing any available, make an invisible split. As noted later, all
DDP/album metadata is now added via the new reaimgui-based window.</p>
<h2 id="set-recording-primary-and-secondary">Set recording primary and
secondary</h2>
<p>An automatic occurrence as part of a new project setup. If you set a
secondary recording path in Mission Control, it will record to it
without the user having to open every track routing dialog.</p>
<h2 id="force-strict-mixer-order">Force strict mixer order</h2>
<p>When syncing, mix order will be rearranged if out of order.</p>
<h2 id="allow-finding-takes-via-item-name">Allow finding takes via item
name</h2>
<p>Set this option in F5 preferences to find takes via the item name vs
the more robust file name approach (useful if your original files were
named randomly!).</p>
<h2 id="graded-color-scheme">Graded color scheme</h2>
<p>ReaClassical 26 boosts a standard, repeatable graded color scheme to
help users know where their edits are coming from. Set the unedited
items color to checked in F5 preferences if you want unedited material
to be the default REAPER item color.</p>
<h2 id="find-source-material">Find Source material</h2>
<p>In addition to the graded color scheme, users can find source
material by selecting an edit and pressing Ctrl+F. The source group is
selected and source IN/OUT markers placed around the material.</p>
<h2 id="edited-items-use-source-coloring-whenever-possible">Edited items
use source coloring whenever possible</h2>
<p>Again, as part of the graded color scheme, if the user adds a new
folder, the colors will be automatically adjusted so that whenever
possible, edits match the source material folder color.</p>
<h2 id="ensure-correct-order-for-destination-and-sources">Ensure correct
order for destination and sources</h2>
<p>Similar to the strict mix order, destination and source folders are
automatically re-ordered whenever sync is run behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="allow-promotion-of-any-source-folder-to-destination">Allow
Promotion of any source folder to destination</h2>
<p>Press Ctrl+Alt+P to promote any source folder to be the
destination.</p>
<h2 id="heal-edit">Heal edit</h2>
<p>Select an edit and press Ctrl+H to heal the edit – it’s as if the
edit never happened! This can be done at any time even if subsequent
edits have occurred. This only works if there was underlying material
(perfect for 4-point editing).</p>
<h2 id="notes-app">Notes app</h2>
<p>Press N to open a brand-new ReaClassical notes app for adding notes
to the project, tracks or items. You can also add ranking and also
override take numbering from filename (reset via the button).</p>
<h2 id="allow-xfade-editing-on-any-group">Allow xfade editing on any
group</h2>
<p>With the new REAPER xfade editor, I have removed the restriction on
only being able to edit on the destination folder.</p>
<h2 id="allow-s-d-editing-anywhere-to-anywhere">Allow S-D editing
anywhere to anywhere</h2>
<p>Set destination IN and OUT markers (1 and 2) in the same way as
source IN and OUT. Select your folder first! Alternatively, set “Add S-D
marker at mouse hover” to “1” and forego the initial folder selection.
As the title says, this feature now allows for complete freedom on where
you build your edits (although much can be said for continuing to stick
with the destination folder!).</p>
<h2 id="ddp-metadata-editor">DDP Metadata Editor</h2>
<p>One of the “crown jewels” of the new release which automatically
opens when Y (Create CD Markers) is run. A user-friendly approach to
adding all necessary DDP metadata (and silently generating album
reports, metadata reports and CUE files (for use with continuous WAV or
FLAC export). See render presets for options. Reports and CUE file are
written on close or when switching to another folder track. Note that
each produced file starts with a prefix identifying it with the
folder.</p>
<h2 id="multi-disc-albums">Multi-Disc Albums</h2>
<p>With combined power of the new DDP metadata editor and S-D editing
from anywhere to anywhere comes the ability to produce multi-disc
albums! Add track names to any folder track and press Y. Quickly jump
from one disc to another by simply selecting another folder track you
have set up with item names.</p>
<h2 id="meterbridge">Meterbridge</h2>
<p>Press B to visualize recording levels by peak hold or vertical meter.
When rec-armed, the display shows numbered channels. When auditioning,
the display shows mixer tracks and any other “special” tracks.</p>
<h2 id="microphone-indicator">Microphone Indicator</h2>
<p>Alt+R. A great way for conductors and performers to check the
recording status on a monitor in the venue. Offline (grey), standby
(green, rec-armed), recording (red) and paused (yellow) modes.</p>
<h2 id="reavision-metering-suite">ReaVision Metering Suite</h2>
<p>A new entry to the RCPlugs JSFX collection. All the metering you
could want in a single window – loudness and true peak read-outs (reset
by clicking on any of the numbers), K-meter (cycle through K-20, K-14
and K-12), goniometer (with visual boosts by clicking on the label),
phase correlation, bit meter, spectrum analyzer and spectrogram!</p>
<h2 id="cd-marker-offsets">CD Marker Offsets</h2>
<p>For situations where, for example, a string soloist might
accidentally touch a string just before the down beat in an otherwise
stellar capture, this allows you to offset the CD marker – perfect when
you have some recorded or generated room tone on the dedicated room tone
track. To offset one or more markers, select the folder associated with
the markers, move the maker(s) to where you want (audition so it feels
musical!) and then press Shift+O. Offset values are added to the item
name and are relative to the item starts so that the placement is always
repeatable. Press Alt+O to remove all offsets.</p>
<h2 id="record-panel-formerly-take-counter">Record Panel (formerly Take
Counter)</h2>
<p>Open via Ctrl+Enter or F9. The take counter has been upgraded to
include transport buttons and take ranking and notes. The ranking and
notes are applied to the item created when recording is stopped.</p>
<h2 id="mixer-snapshots-manager">Mixer Snapshots Manager</h2>
<p>Shift+M. The very latest addition to ReaClassical 26. Mixer scenes
and automation for humans! Set snaphots at edit cursor or time selection
with auto recall during playback and changing edit cursor position
during transport stop. 4 independent banks with copy between
functionality. Disable auto-recall to turn the manager into a simple
manual recall by clicking on a table row. Hide markers to declutter the
timeline but still allow for auto recall.</p>
