==== Updating an Existing ReaClassical Portable Install

To update just the functions, use menu:Extensions[ReaPack > Synchronize packages]. To update the functions and also update/reset the custom toolbar and keymaps to be in line with a standard ReaClassical portable install, run the handy _ReaClassical Updater_ function via kbd:[Shift+U]. This will sync ReaPack to get the latest ReaClassical functions then offer to overwrite your toolbars and keymaps with ReaClassical portable install defaults.

CAUTION: Don't do this if you have your own custom toolbars or keyboard shortcuts as they will be overwritten! However, as of 24.8.7 any files will first be backed up (e.g. reaper-kb.ini.backup). Obviously if you run the updater twice before recovering them you will lose your original files.

==== Updating REAPER

Simply use the shortcut kbd:[Ctrl+U] to open the REAPER updater. If you are already on the recommended version, a wrapper will notify you and offer to exit. If your version is either below or above the recommended one, youâ€™ll see a message alerting you, and the REAPER utility will then open so you can manually upgrade or downgrade.

Either click on the main or pre-release version you are interested in or click on one of the clock icons to select from previous releases. Despite the REAPER developers having a track record of excellent compatibility across even major versions, I recommend sticking with the tested version of REAPER noted https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chmaha/ReaClassical/main/tested_reaper_ver.txt[here] to minimize any issues of compatibility.
