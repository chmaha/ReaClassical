DDP is a Registered Trademark of DCA Inc., 1989-2008

The DDP format is used to prepare files for audio CD manufacturing.
Please set the render output format to 44100Hz, 16-bit, stereo.
This is the only format supported by audio CDs.

DDP output consists of many files, all of which must be sent to the CD manufacturer.

For standard CDs, the Red Book specification includes these limitations:
- at least one track
- INDEX0 is required for the first track, set to 0 seconds
- INDEX1 for the first track must be set to 2 seconds or later
  (audio content prior to 2 seconds will be ignored)
- minimum track length is 4 seconds
  (time between INDEX1 of one track and INDEX0/INDEX1 of the following track)
- INDEX1 must be at least 1 frame (1/75 second) after INDEX0, if INDEX0 is defined
- audio is padded with silence to be frame (1/75 second) aligned

------------------------------------------------

Album and track metadata is set by project marker names:
- markers starting with the "@" character represent album metadata
- markers starting with the "!" character represent the INDEX0 position for the following "#" track
- markers starting with the "#" character represent track metadata and the INDEX1 position

If there is more than one @ marker, each one overwrites the values defined by the previous marker.
If there are multiple ! markers in a single track, only the last marker prior to the # marker is used.
The number of # markers represents the number of CD tracks.
@ markers can be anywhere, but the most readable position is at the end of the album.

If the audio data is too short, ! and # markers positioned more than 10 seconds after
the end of the audio will be ignored.
Audio will be padded with silence and frame-aligned (1/75 second) until the last used marker.

Metadata is in "KEY1=VALUE1|KEY2=VALUE2|KEY3=VALUE3" format.
There can be any number of KEY=VALUE pairs. KEYs are case insensitive.

@ (album) markers support these metadata keys:
- "CATALOG", "EAN" or "UPC" for the same EAN/UPC number
- "ALBUM", "TITLE", or no key (VALUE only) for the album title
- "PERFORMER"
- "SONGWRITER"
- "COMPOSER"
- "ARRANGER"
- "MESSAGE"
- "IDENTIFICATION"
- "GENRE", which may be any text, or as one of the predefined genres in the list below
- "LANGUAGE", which must be one of the defined languages in the list below

# (track) markers support these metadata keys:
- "ISRC", international standard recording code for each track
- "TITLE" or no key (VALUE only) for the track title
- "PERFORMER", which must also be included in the @ marker if used
  (for example, the track marker might include "PERFORMER=Jane Doe"
  and the album marker might include "PERFORMER=various")
- "SONGWRITER", which must also be included in the @ marker if used
- "COMPOSER", which must also be included in the @ marker if used
- "ARRANGER", which must also be included in the @ marker if used
- "MESSAGE"

! (index) markers will ignore any metadata, only the position is used.

------------------------------------------------

The CD-TEXT file will be exported only if CD-TEXT metadata is included.
CD-TEXT metadata includes all keys  except the "CATALOG", "EAN", "UPC" and "ISRC".
