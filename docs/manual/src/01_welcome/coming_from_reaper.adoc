=== Coming from Standard REAPER

It is a very good idea to have a basic fluency in how REAPER works. However, much of ReaClassical relies on different workflows than you will be used to. So, with that in mind,

==== Do

- Learn how items are dragged and trimmed in REAPER
- Continue using REAPER's mixer to set faders, panning, mute, solo (if you wish)
- Set up a ReaClassical project by first running kbd:[Ctrl+N]

==== Don't

- Engage in any track and folder management (naming & renaming, creating, deleting, reordering etc) outside of Mission Control 
- Set recording inputs outside of Mission Control
- Create custom track routing outside of Mission Control
- Create custom item groupings

==== Avoid

- Using regular transport controls for recording or playback
