=== Mixing

==== Mixing Scenes

1. Add FX, change routing, and optionally adjust volume, panning etc via Mission Control kbd:[C]
2. Open Mixer Snapshot Manager via kbd:[Shift+M]
3. Create automatically-recalled mixer snapshots tied to items.

NOTE: If setting a snapshot tied to an unnamed item, the first part of the item's ID will be used as the identifier in the table row.

===== Mixer Snapshot Manager in Detail

IMPORTANT: For auto recall of mixer snapshots to work, the Mixer Snapshots Manager must remain open.

==== Volume Automation

1. Ensure that a "Destination" or "Source" track is selected.
2. Position edit cursor or create a time selection and press kbd:[I]. Edit cursor mode affects the time line position and everything following. Time selection mode is limited to the time selection bounds.
3. Set volume level and optional ramp in/out lengths and click btn:[Apply Automation]

==== More Advanced Automation

Turn on advanced mode to gain access to all envelopes associated with the track including FX parameters. If you also need to automate various aspects of the mixer tracks or special tracks, first make them visible in the track control panel by checking the box on the desired track row in Mission Control. Use kbd:[I] as before.

==== Editing Automation Items

Right-click on an automation item to edit middle value and optional ramp in and out values. You can adjust the positioning by left-click dragging on the item itself. Adjust the middle value length by alt/opt-click dragging on automation item edges.

==== General Mixing Workflow Suggestions

- Set piece-by-piece "scenes" using the Mixer Snapshots Manager adjusting mixer tracks, aux and submix controls and any FX parameters. 
- Make temporary adjustments (for example, volume of spot microphones etc) via the automation function kbd:[I] on tracks with items or visible mixer tracks.
- For spot microphones that should be mostly muted:
    1. Use a time selection + kbd:[I] to reduce to lowest value (-150dB/-inf) for the whole piece or use edit cursor + kbd:[I] at the beginning of the timeline to affect the whole project.
    2. Use further time selections + kbd:[I] to set required values and any ramping in and out.

TIP: Remember that the mixer tracks (the ones starting "M:") are fed by the destination and source folders you see in the arrange window. In other words, any automation you add to destination or source tracks will be filtered through the mixer track state. As an example, if your violin spot microphone channel is set at -5dB via automation but the violin spot mixer track fader is at -40dB, the actual output will be -45dB.

==== Mixing for Dolby Atmos Using Fiedler Plugins

If you have the Fiedler Beam plugin on your system, use the Mission Control btn:[Enable Atmos] that appears to add RCFader plugins and Fiedler Beam plugins to every Mixer track as necessary. This will also pass the current mixer fader values to the RCFader plugin. Subsequent presses of the button will check presence of RCFader and Fiedler plugins, and relative position between them, and synchronize fader values. Use btn:[Disable Atmos] to deactivate both RCFader and Fiedler Beam plugins on every mixer track.

==== Mixing with Outboard Gear

Use the Mission Control btn:[HW Outputs] to set direct connections to hardware either automatically or manually. If you do not need connections to RCMASTER, disable using the dedicated button in the main Mission Control window.
