=== Mixing

==== Mixing Scenes

1. Add FX, change routing, and optionally adjust volume, panning etc via Mission Control kbd:[C]
2. Open Mixer Snapshot Manager via kbd:[Shift+M]
3. Create automatically-recalled mixer snapshots tied to named items (see the <<mastering>> section for details of setting up album tracks)

===== Mixer Snapshot Manager in Detail

IMPORTANT: For auto recall of mixer snapshots to work, the Mixer Snapshots Manager must remain open.

==== Volume Automation

1. Ensure one or more "Destination" or "Source" folder tracks are selected
2. Position edit cursor or create a time selection and press kbd:[I]. Edit cursor mode affects the time line position and everything following. Time selection mode is limited to the time selection bounds.
3. Set volume level and optional ramp in/out lengths and click btn:[Apply Automation]

==== General Mixing Workflow Suggestions

- Set piece-by-piece "scenes" using the Mixer Snapshots Manager
- Make temporary volume adjustments to spot microphones etc via the automation function kbd:[I]
- For spot microphones that should be otherwise muted, use mixer scenes to mute and for pieces that require some fader riding, unmute for those pieces:
    1. Use a time selection + kbd:[I] to reduce to lowest value (-150dB/-inf) for the whole piece
    2. Use further time selections + kbd:[I] to set required values and any ramping in and out.

==== More Advanced Automation

If you also need to automate various aspects of the mixer tracks or special tracks, make them visible in the track control panel by checking the box on the desired track row in Mission Control. Then, use kbd:[I] for ReaClassical volume automation or, for everything else, follow standard REAPER automation workflows.

==== Mixing for Dolby Atmos Using Fiedler Plugins

If you have the Fiedler Beam plugin on your system, use the Mission Control btn:[Enable Atmos] that appears to add RCFader plugins and Fiedler Beam plugins to every Mixer track as necessary. This will also pass the current mixer fader values to the RCFader plugin. Subsequent presses of the button will check presence of RCFader and Fiedler plugins, and relative position between them, and synchronize fader values. Use btn:[Disable Atmos] to deactivate both RCFader and Fiedler Beam plugins on every mixer track.

==== Mixing with Outboard Gear

Use the Mission Control btn:[HW Outputs] to set direct connections to hardware either automatically or manually. If you do not need connections to RCMASTER, disable using the dedicated button in the main Mission Control window.
