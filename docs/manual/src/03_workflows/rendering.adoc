==== Presets

ReaClassical includes various rendering presets to make rendering extremely quick and easy. In the Render dialog kbd:[R], click on the presets button then `All Settings`. The preset names are self-explanatory. The first four entries are for exporting a whole album as a single audio file. The remaining use the automatically created regions after using the Create CD Markers function kbd:[Y] to create automatically named folders of audio files, one per CD track. After selecting a preset, you should feel free to change any render settings and perhaps save as a new preset for future use. By default, the presets use the built-in REAPER standard triangular dither.

==== Samplerate

Now that r8brain free has been introduced as the best quality resampler available in REAPER (I highly recommend double-checking that it is selected when resampling at render time) I feel I can do everything, including DDP creation, without leaving my favorite DAW. However, generating a CUE file via the Create CD Markers function is still useful for all sorts of things and I often create FLAC + CUE for album playback in my media player or WAV + CUE to easily burn a CD at home.

==== Dither

Use either the built-in REAPER dither options or RCDither as the last plugin on the master chain. If using RCDither or any other 3rd-party dither be sure to keep the master fader at unity and disable all REAPER dither checkboxes.

==== Loudness & Limiting

REAPER has a fantastic rendering feature which allows the user to set a desired loudness and peak / true peak setting. For quick exports that need to meet certain targets (i.e. streaming) this makes things extremely efficient and is very transparent when not set to extreme values.

==== Dry-run Rendering

Another REAPER feature that is outstanding is the dry-run render function which allows for very quick offline loudness and peak checks and much faster than using REAPER's included realtime loudness meter. It is therefore extremely easy to set up compressors, limiters etc in the project and make small adjustments based on the dry-run values and maintain complete control over the process.

==== Other Rendering Tips

Not necessarily obvious to new REAPER users are the special =START and =END markers (make your markers in the usual way and label them accordingly) that constrain the length of the project. Rather than rely on extended silence at the end of items or time selections, the =END marker is a great way to ensure you have the exact amount of lead-out you want at the end of the disc. Positioning both special markers is great way to generate files for multi-disc releases without having to rely on multiple projects.

You will hopefully notice I have included various shortcuts for manually creating regions (single or multiple) from items and time selection (great for quickly generating demo snippets). Also worth noting is that you can still do some (or all!) of your source-destination editing with your track markers in place as the S/D markers have IDs far higher than any classical CD would have and are automatically deleted after a successful edit. As long as you have your ripple-per-track mode engaged, all your existing marker placements and carefully crafted edits will remain intact. But, again, don't manually create CD markers at this point as I include a very powerful tool to make light work of that side of mastering.
