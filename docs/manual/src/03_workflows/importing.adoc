=== Importing

While it is always better to record in ReaClassical for traditional recording sessions, you may prefer using a portable recorder for live performances. Further, you might need to import audio recorded by other engineers who used a different DAW.

==== Importing Audio from a Portable Recorder

If you use a portable recorder such as a MixPre, you might have a multi-channel combined file. ReaClassical includes a special function for converting these into a stereo pair + mono track set. Import your multi-channel media using a single regular track (for a horizontal workflow) or multiple regular tracks (for a vertical workflow). Press kbd:[F10] (no need to select the items). Answer btn:[yes] to the prompt that appears if the first two channels should be treated as stereo interleaved (i.e. they represent your main pair). Depending on the choice made, the number of tracks in the resulting folder(s) will adjust accordingly. You are then given the opportunity to name your tracks in Mission Control. Obviously if you decide to move to a vertical workflow after exploding using a single track, you can always use Mission Control to convert. If you need to bring in new takes after running this function, simply open an empty project tab, import additional media then run the function there. Afterwards, copy or cut the exploded items into the original project tab to the desired locations.

==== Smart Import

Ensure that all your files comply with one of the following patterns (where x represents a digit):

- `sessionname_trackname_Txxx.wav`
- `sessionname_trackname_xxx.wav`
- `trackname_Txx.wav`
- `trackname_xxx.wav`

The take number should always be positioned just before the file extension. The "T" (for take) and any zero-padding are optional but there should always be at least a preceding underscore. 

Examples of good filenaming include:

- `morning_cello_012.wav` (where session is "morning", track name will match "cello" and represents take 12)
- `harpsichord_T4.flac` (no session name, track name will match "harpsichord" and represents take 4)

Examples of bad filenaming include:

- `005.wav` (no trackname)
- `violin56.wav` (no underscore before take name)
- `Day1Mozart_67.wav` (no underscore between session and track name)

IMPORTANT: Don't skip this renaming step if you want to import files easily from another DAW! Manual import by dragging in material can be time-consuming and may not allow you to use functions like searching by take number. 

Assuming that the filenames now contain at least a track name and take number separated by underscore:

1. Ensure that you have first created an empty horizontal or vertical workflow ReaClassical project.
2. Copy or move source material into the media subfolder inside your ReaClassical project folder. 
3. Ensure that track names in the project match the channel text in the filenames
4. If your filenames also contain a session name prior to the track name, the items will be grouped accordingly.
5. Via the top ReaClassical menu, click on menu:Project Setup[Smart Audio Import] and, if using vertical workflow, choose distribution options.
6. Open Mission Control kbd:[C] to add special tracks such as aux & submix, make routing adjustments etc.

==== Manual Import by Dragging

1. In your source folder, select items that should be aligned vertically (for example, every channel for particular take) and drag into the ReaClassical project being sure to drop onto one of the folders created by ReaClassical with a track count that matches the number of files you selected. Choose the option "Same time position on separate tracks"
2. Continue as above for each take
3. Open Mission Control kbd:[C] to add special tracks such as aux & submix, make routing adjustments etc.
