=== Navigating a Project

In addition to built-in REAPER functions, ReaClassical uses a series of shortcuts to help you easily navigate your classical project. Important: I always make some dedicated time post-recording to get an overview of the recorded material, tidy up the digital notes I took during the session and perform a backup on an external drive as soon as possible.

==== Whole Project

Use kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+{cursorright}] to see the whole project horizontally and/or kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+{cursordown}] to see everything vertically. If you want to zoom both horizontally and vertically at the same time, use kbd:[`] (backtick). You can also go to the start or end of the project by pressing the kbd:[Home] or kbd:[End] key respectively.

==== Finding Takes

Use kbd:[Enter] on the main keyboard or numpad to quickly search for a take based on the underlying filename of the media item. This will work for any file-naming system that uses numbers before the file extension such as _main_pair-T04.wav_, _cello-spot-take_23.flac_ or even _ortf_pair(04).wav_ such as created by Presonus Studio One. Note that if the imported or recorded files have zero-padding that is not a problem. If you have used an item to create an S-D edit, searching for a take will ignore these items and move directly to the original sources.

In kbd:[F5] preferences, you can set to search by item name instead. In the ReaClassical Notes app kbd:[N], you can override and reset take numbers. These take priority in the search.

==== Jump to Time

Press kbd:[TAB] to jump to a specific absolute or relative time using right-aligned logic, similar to video editing applications. This can be an absolute time within the project or an relative position inside a selected item or a set of consecutive crossfaded items. Prefix with + or - to make relative jumps. Once you get the hang of using this input logic, moving to any position is extremely quick!

| Input | Meaning (based on project frame rate) 

| `100524`  
| Move to absolute position 10m 5s 24f  

| `1141711`  
| Move to absolute position 1h 14m 17s 11f

| `+8`  
| Jump forward by 8 frames

| `-1015`  
| Jump backward by 10s 15f

| `+23000`  
| Jump forward by 2m 30s (and 0 frames)

==== Items & Markers

You can easily shuffle back and forth between item edges by using the kbd:[Q] and kbd:[W] keys. You can move between markers by using the kbd:[,] and kbd:[.] keys (by design given on my keyboard they are the same keys that have kbd:[<] and kbd:[>]). 

==== Parents & Children

ReaClassical can hide or show children of track folders. This means that editing multi-track classical music can be as easy as editing a stereo track. Making an edit to the parent track automatically makes the same one to all the children too. To show hidden children select the parent track and press kbd:[D] (for _display_). To hide, select the parent track and press kbd:[E] (for _https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ensconce[ensconce]_). The other benefit is that a whole set of takes can be displayed vertically in the main editing window without too much effort.

==== Peaks Display

To adjust the visual zoom of wave peaks, use kbd:[Ctrl+{cursorup}] and kbd:[Ctrl+{cursordown}]. This is purely visual and allows for easier editing of quieter sections.

==== ReaClassical S-D Editing Toolbar

While I designed ReaClassical to be used efficiently with keyboard shortcuts, there is a custom S-D editing toolbar for those that prefer it. However I do highly recommend learning the key strokes as you will find your editing speeds improve dramatically. The floating toolbar can be opened via kbd:[F6] but will automatically open once when you start source-destination editing. Right-click to set a different icon layout and/or zoom.

Hover over the icons to discover what is available.

==== ReaClassical Top Menu

At the top of the arrange window, you will see a dedicated ReaClassical menu (in between `Options` and `Extensions`). While not intended to be used as the primary way of running ReaClassical functions, it is an organized way of discovering the individual available functions and learning the keyboard shortcuts.

==== Summary of Track Types in ReaClassical

While some of these will be covered later in the manual, it is useful to give a summary of track types you can currently use in ReaClassical. First, we have the _regular_ folder or folder of tracks shown in the arrange window. These are where you record or import takes. Second, we have the mixer tracks designated via `M:` prefix. These tracks shown only in the mixer are where you adjust the usual track controls such as names, pan, volume, phase, add FX etc. Their names are synced across the project via when added or renamed via Mission Control. Third, we have aux busses designated via `@` prefix. You can route mixer tracks to these to use as a reverb bus etc. Fourth, we have submix busses designated via _#_ prefix. You can route mixer tracks to these as a way to collect together microphones from the same orchestral section etc. Fifth, we have a dedicated room tone track where you can place recorded or generated room tone (more on this in the mastering section). Sixth, we have the _RCMASTER_ bus which leads directly to the master REAPER bus. Here you can gain stage into the master bus, add FX etc. Seventh, we have reference tracks which lie outside of the RCMASTER structure thereby allowing the user to quickly make comparisons with other imported material via the audition shortcuts. Next, have the possibility of a live bounce track. This also lies outside of the RCMASTER structure and is a way to capture a live stereo mix from the RCMASTER track. 

NOTE: Live bounce tracks are only available when recording in a horizontal workflow.

Next, another track outside of the RCMASTER structure is the listenback track. This is a way to monitor musicians, conductors, producers etc who might be far away and need to communicate with the recording engineer via a microphone channel. Finally, the master bus itself where again you can set final levels, add FX etc. As mentioned elsewhere, try not to delete the mixer tracks or RCMASTER. But, even if you do by accident, open Mission Control kbd:[C] to recreate them.

IMPORTANT: A reminder to do all track management in Mission Control!
