=== Install

For the complete and recommended experience on Linux, macOS, and Windows, run the single install script provided below. 

IMPORTANT: You do not need to download or install REAPER separately and you shouldn't try to install ReaClassical inside an existing REAPER setup — ReaClassical comes bundled with its own fully-configured REAPER environment.

==== Easy Complete Portable Installation (official method)
Copy the command for your operating system into either your terminal (MacOS and Linux) or PowerShell (Windows).

MacOS:
[source,bash]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://reaclassical.org/macos | sh
----

Linux:
[source,bash]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://reaclassical.org/linux | sh
----

Windows:
[source,powershell]
----
irm "https://reaclassical.org/win" | iex
----

TIP: Note that if the ReaClassical folder already exists, the installer will automatically add a unique suffix to ensure nothing is overwritten.
