==== Notes

===== Track Count

A folder requires at least two tracks. If you really only need a single microphone pair for audio capture, consider 1) having left and right on separate channels, or 2) Having an empty second track that you can easily hide via a dedicated shortcut.

===== Workflow Choice

A _horizontal_ workflow approach means that recorded or imported takes are arranged left-to-right in a single folder. A _vertical_ workflow approach is designed for recorded takes of similar material to be stacked vertically.

==== Mission Control

As soon as you press btn:[OK], you will see the Mission Control window.
