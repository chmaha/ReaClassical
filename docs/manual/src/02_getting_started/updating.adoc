=== Update

==== Updating an Existing ReaClassical Portable Install

WARNING: If coming from ReaClassical 25, do not update but download a fresh copy of version 26.

Use menu:Extensions[ReaPack > Synchronize packages] or press kbd:[Shift+U]. This will sync ReaPack to get the latest ReaClassical functions.

==== Factory Reset

In the ReaClassical top menu, click on ReaClassical Factory Reset to return most settings back to those presented at first install.

==== Updating REAPER

It is highly advisable to use the version of REAPER that ships with ReaClassical. Due to potential incompatibility issues, for ReaClassical 26 onwards, the third-party REAPER update utility has been removed from the install package.
