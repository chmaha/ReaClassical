=== Collaborating with Video Editors

When working on projects that combine audio and video, the audio engineer must ensure that high-resolution audio edits remain synchronized with the final assembled video.

Several approaches exist:

* *No audio edits required* – The simplest case. The video editor is free to select camera angles without concerns about audio sync.
* *Post-edited audio with playback* – The promotional video is recorded after the audio has been edited, with musicians miming or playing along to playback via loudspeaker. The video editor has complete freedom to cut between angles without sync issues. This method isn’t always feasible.
* *Minor edits in live-recorded video* – When video and audio are recorded simultaneously and only minor edits are needed, the video editor can use a zoomed-out shot of the concert hall, a musician’s face, or another visual to mask a slight time-stretch while preserving timecode accuracy.
* *Multiple synchronized takes* – The most complex scenario. Both video and audio are recorded in multiple takes and synchronized via a timeclock. This is the focus of the following discussion.

ReaClassical provides tools to generate an edit list for video editors. Rather than a file for direct import, this list serves as a manual reference. For all recordings, but especially those synchronized to a timeclock, REAPER/ReaClassical retains the timeline start position from the recording. This ensures that absolute in/out source positions can be retrieved even after extensive audio edits.

To create an edit list:

. Perform source-destination edits as usual.
. Set the desired project framerate in the video tab of Project Settings via kbd:[P].
. Export the edit list via menu:ReaClassical[Utilities > Build Edit List]:
.. Select _using BWF start offset_ for timeclock-synced projects.
.. Choose _using source file timing_ to reference internal source audio positions. In this case, the audio engineer should provide a a single channel of audio to help the video editor locate edit points.

The resulting HTML table includes a `Done` column for tracking progress. Additionally, when using _Build Edit List (using BWF Start Offset)_, an optional offset can be applied to correct slight constant audio-video misalignment.
