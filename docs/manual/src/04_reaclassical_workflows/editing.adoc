=== Editing

==== Introduction to Editing Workflows

Once you have recorded or imported your classical music audio, you are ready to start editing the raw material! Here we talk about the meat and potatoes of the classical editing workflows. Workflows—plural—because I have included different approaches to suit as many tastes as possible within the confines of the REAPER application. I will explain each in detail after this brief introduction. As described previously, you have multiple ways of proceeding. First you can have all your takes lined up in a row horizontally and you place your source in and out markers, destination in and out markers then press a keyboard shortcut to achieve your 2-, 3- or 4-point edit. The second way is to set up your takes vertically and then either use the same marker system to make your edits or use razor edits (my preferred method when working vertically). Whichever option you choose, you will then end up in the crossfade editor view which uses a two-lane view to make precise edits really easy in REAPER.

==== Marking Edits on your Scores

This is best done using a physical, photocopied score by the conductor or lead musician. I advocate for a “T” system where a large T is inserted into the score at the intended edit point. Either side of the T stem, and under the crossbar, the outgoing and incoming take numbers are written. A wavy crossbar indicates some leeway for where the edit point can be placed. Further notes can be attached underneath the T such as directions for tightening the gap etc.

==== Preparing Takes

Whether working horizontally or vertically, you can use the Prepare Takes function. It is intelligent enough to figure out which workflow you are using. Just press kbd:[T] (for _Takes_). Super simple! Every set of items comprising a take has changed color, is now grouped. In addition, source and destination groups are linked or (re-linked) for various types of editing.

.Horizontally Prepared Takes

.Vertically Prepared Takes

If Prepare the `Prepare Takes: Random colors` value is set to 0 in ReaClassical Preferences kbd:[F5] (the default), for horizontal workflows, two shades of blue are used which also helps show the user where edits happen. For vertical workflows, the destination group again uses two shades of blue and the source groups are colored green. In this way they match the colors of the associated S-D markers. If `Prepare Takes: Random colors` value is set to 1, for horizontally laid-out takes, each complete take is colored with a different random color. For vertically laid-out takes, each folder's items are given a different random color. This way, however you work, it's easy to see where edits have come from. Prepare Takes can be re-run at any point to re-sync colors and will preserve any custom colors set via the Colorize function kbd:[K].

In the cases where you might use the function after editing has begun, the destination group will switch to using alternating colors for items so that you can easily tell where you have made edits.

==== Auditioning Takes

For horizontal editing, you could use the usual transport shortcuts (spacebar to start and stop playback, for example). However, for both horizontal and vertical editing, it is highly recommended to use the Audition function to quickly solo only the folder (or track) you are interested in hearing. Just hover the mouse over the parent for the full mix or a child to solo a spot microphone you want to hear and press kbd:[A]. This includes any @ aux or # submix track routing in the signal path. You can easily and quickly create your own custom audition mix by engaging solo or mute buttons on the mixer, aux and submix tracks (either with transport stopped or on the fly) and using hover + kbd:[A] on the parent track. You can therefore listen to anything from the full mix down to examining just the woodwinds submix or a single reverb bus. To audition using a custom playback rate, use hover + kbd:[Shift+A]. The custom playback rate can be set via kbd:[F5]. Note that regular auditioning will automatically reset to the standard playback rate.

Don't forget that you can quickly jump to your various source takes using kbd:[Enter] and jump to a time within a selected item or crossfaded items using kbd:[Tab].

==== Source-Destination Editing

You set your in and out points using special colored labeled markers via shortcuts kbd:[1] and kbd:[2] (Destination) and kbd:[3] and kbd:[4] (Source). Simply press kbd:[5] to make the 2-, 3- or 4-point edit. depending on how many markers you set. If you attempt to set one of the destination markers inside of an existing crossfade or within 500ms of a crossfade or item edge, the function will alert you (pressing btn:[OK] places the marker anyway). This helps avoid awkward _sliver_ edits that can happen especially if you are zoomed out and placing markers by ear. You can customize the check range via ReaClassical Preferences (kbd:[F5]). The check range (in milliseconds) is the distance beyond an item edge, fade or crossfade. For example, setting to 0 would only check for placement _inside_ a fade or crossfade.

You'll also notice that because you prepared the various takes with colors (and grouping), it is really easy to see which takes compose your final edited tracks. It's worth pointing out that my S/D and classical crossfade functions place the crossfade immediately before the entry and exit points of the pasted audio. The crossfade length and other values can be set on a per-project basis via ReaClassical Project Preferences (kbd:[F5]). In practice this means that if you visually set a marker (or edit cursor in the case of the classical crossfade function) immediately before a transient, said transient will sound post-crossfade which is what we generally desire. Often, given this important detail, I don't even need to visit the crossfade editor view.

When using a vertical workflow, make sure you have the source folder selected before you create the source IN and OUT markers. You can do so by clicking on the item at the locations you want to set the markers. This adds the folder number as a prefix to the source marker labels. The various functions will then use this label to know which folder to copy from. This is really useful if you undo the edit in order to tweak the markers by dragging them. It doesn't matter if you then select other folders/tracks. In the event you use two different folders for the source IN and OUT markers, the functions will prefer the source IN label.

The downside to this workflow when using a vertical approach is that the source and destination markers can get in each other's way visually if the takes aren't somewhat staggered, however the process still works as expected. See below for a razor editing alternative.

TIP: If you are worried about accidentally moving markers and items during precise S-D or assembly editing, engage the padlock icon in the top-left of the ReaClassical window. By default with the latest ReaClassical project template, it should prevent manual left/right item movement and marker dragging (while still allowing for S-D editing with ripple). Even though you can't move S-D markers by dragging with this lock mode engaged, you can still use the shortcuts_ kbd:[1], kbd:[2], kbd:[3] and kbd:[4] to change marker location. Just remember to disengage lock mode when you enter the fade editor or else you won't be able to move the items of the crossfade!

===== Multi-Project Tab S-D Editing

If you'd like to S-D edit between various open project tabs you can set both the source and destination _project_ markers via kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+1] (or kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+2]) for destination and kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+3] (or kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+4]) for source (essentially the same numbers associated with regular S-D markers). The markers can exist anywhere on the tab's timeline but perhaps the very beginning or end would be good to keep them out of the way. The S-D editing itself then works just as for a single tab other than any source markers that are set are not deleted to aid quickly undoing in the destination tab and being ready to reapply the edit. The only rule when using S-D project markers is to ensure that source or destination markers should be paired with the corresponding source or destination project marker. This workflow would, for example, allow you to have multiple project tabs (perhaps one for each symphony movement plus a final _destination_ tab), allowing for both internal editing per tab but after setting the S-D project markers compiling the final edit in the _destination_ tab. To delete all the S-D project markers press kbd:[Shift+Delete]. Also, in multi-tab S-D editing, when regular markers are placed, any other existing versions in other tabs are automatically deleted to ensure that only one version of the marker exists at a time across all open project tabs.

===== 4-Point Editing

For this operation, set all four markers using kbd:[1], kbd:[2], kbd:[3] and kbd:[4]. Make the edit with kbd:[5]. This is the most useful edit when dealing with classical music or other acoustic music performed without a metronome.

===== 3-Point Editing

For this operation, set any combination of three markers. Again, make the edit with kbd:[5]. The missing marker is placed according to the distance set by the existing complete pair.

===== 2-Point Editing

For this operation, there are two possibilities: 1) Set one source marker and one destination marker. Make the edit with kbd:[5]. Any missing IN markers are set to the beginning of the timeline and any missing OUT markers are set to the end of the source or destination material. 2) Set both source markers and no destination markers. Make the edit with . Here, the destination markers are set at the exact same positions on the timeline as the source markers. Obviously this operation is only useful in a vertical editing workflow when you can select source material from a different track group. The usefulness of this second option is further reduced if the takes are not vertically aligned and not virtually identical in tempo. On the other hand, it could be an incredibly quick method for editing takes of a hybrid classical piece that is performed to a click track or other recorded steady beat.

==== Other SD Functions

===== Insert with Time-Stretching

Using the ReaClassical_Insert with time-stretching function kbd:[F4], you can complete a 4-point edit where the material between the source markers is time-stretched to fit the length of time between the destination markers. This is really useful when the source material has to fit the destination span exactly, for example when working with visual cues. The time-stretch algorithm used will be the one set in REAPER project settings. When there are multiple items in between the source markers, the function will glue the items together before time-stretching. Note that this function can also be used in multi-tab S-D editing mode (see above).

===== Assembly Line Editing

Sometimes you don't necessarily have a best overall take and it is desirable to build the perfect performance linearly, section by section, measure by measure. In this case, set the destination IN marker with kbd:[1] and set both source markers using kbd:[3] and kbd:[4]. Press the kbd:[F3] shortcut. A 3-point insert operation will occur and the destination IN marker will jump to the end of the pasted item, ready for the next edit. This means that in order to compile further sections, you now only need set the source markers. If you accidentally move the location of the destination IN marker in the middle of assembly line editing, the function will let you know and offer to move the marker back to the right edge of the latest item in the edit. This will even allow you to do some regular 3- or 4-point editing earlier in the sequence before continuing with the assembly line edits. Just place the destination IN marker anywhere in the project and answer btn:[No] when the message box appears. Note that this function can also be used in multi-tab S-D editing mode (see above).

===== Delete / Delete with Ripple

While perhaps not used as often as 3- and 4-point edits, I have created two functions for deletion of material. Delete & Ripple kbd:[Backspace] will delete the material between source IN and OUT markers and ripple material to the right backwards with a short crossfade. Delete Leaving Silence kbd:[Ctrl+Backspace] will also delete but maintain the silence without rippling backwards.

===== Copy/Move Destination Material to Source

Run either the copy or move version of the function from the ReaClassical toolbar (no need to ensure the first track is selected) and the function will copy or move all items and edits from the destination group directly below to a newly created source group with Eastern Blue color for identification purposes. This allows for saving versions of finished edits either via iteration (_copying_ so you can continue to make further edits) or fresh (_moving_ so you can compile an alternate version of a best take from scratch). These different edits can then be easily auditioned via kbd:[A] the shortcut. This is similar to a Pyramix-style iterative editing method while still maintaining the destination group as the uppermost group.

===== Reverse S-D Edit

Place your destination markers using kbd:[1] and kbd:[2], then set a source IN marker with kbd:[3]. Pressing kbd:[6] will copy or move the material between the destination IN and OUT markers to the selected source group, as determined by the kbd:[3] shortcut. Upon execution, you will be prompted to choose whether to copy or move the material. This function operates similarly to the *Copy/Move Destination Material to Source* functions but allows for precise selection using S-D markers. It is particularly useful for editing a single section like a _da capo_, where you may want to construct an edit using material from the first run-through without having to scroll back and forth along the timeline. For example:

* To use material from the first run, copy it to an existing empty _placeholder_ source group using kbd:[6] (answering btn:[No] when prompted to delete the destination material), then manually position it under the second run.
* If the da capo material serves as a strong foundation, you can leave it in place on the destination group. Alternatively, you can move the da capo material to a second empty source group using kbd:[6], selecting btn:[yes] when prompted to delete the destination material.

===== Add S-D Markers to Edges of Item(s) or Time Selection

Used in combination with Delete / Delete with Ripple (kbd:[Ctrl+Backspace]/kbd:[Backspace]), you can quickly set both source markers to the edges of one or more selected items on a parent track or time selection via kbd:[F12]. This is a time-saver when dealing with potential _sliver_ edits i.e. small unneeded leftover edits as a result of multiple rounds of zoomed-out S-D editing. Note that the built-in checks when manually placing destination markers should go some way to alleviating this issue which can easily go unnoticed in other classical music DAWs. Likewise you can use kbd:[Ctrl+F12] to set destination markers (selected items must be in the destination folder). Note that if using time selection for placing source markers, as for S-D marker placement via kbd:[3] or kbd:[4], make sure you first have the desired source folder track selected before pressing the shortcut (a good way to do this is to first click on the item involved). You may prefer to set both source and destination markers this way over the more traditional number key shortcuts acting as a sort of hybrid between S-D and razor editing. Also note that if both selected items and a time selection exist, the time selection takes precedence.

===== Move / Zoom to S-D markers

To move to any existing S-D markers use kbd:[Ctrl+1], kbd:[Ctrl+2], kbd:[Ctrl+3] or kbd:[Ctrl+4]. To zoom to any of the S-D markers for more fine-grained placement, use kbd:[Alt+1], kbd:[Alt+2], kbd:[Alt+3] or kbd:[Alt+4]. If you have multi-tab S-D editing set up, these shortcuts will also automatically move focus to the correct project tab.

===== Delete S-D markers

To delete all regular S-D markers, press kbd:[Ctrl+Delete].

==== Floating Destination Group

The floating destination group feature enhances vertical workflow efficiency by dynamically positioning the destination group just above the selected source group. This reduces unnecessary vertical scrolling when setting IN and OUT markers for destination and source groups that are far apart in the project. Additionally, this feature is fully compatible with mouse hover S-D editing and when setting source markers to item edges (kbd:[F12]).

To enable the floating destination group, open ReaClassical Project Preferences (kbd:[F5]) and set the corresponding value to _1_.

For example, with floating destination enabled, place a source IN marker (via kbd:[3]) on any source group. The destination group will reposition itself just above the selected source group. Add the remaining S-D markers as required. Perform any S-D edits via kbd:[5], kbd:[F4], or kbd:[F3]. Select another source parent and place another marker (kbd:[3]). The destination group will continue adjusting dynamically. To temporarily reset the destination group position, run a sync via kbd:[F8].

It is worth noting that if the destination group moves above a source group, the source marker track number correctly updates to reflect the new order.

To disable floating mode, re-open ReaClassical Project Preferences and set `Floating Destination Group` back to _0_. This will also automatically move the destination group back to the top of the project.

==== Razor Editing

Because of the potential for visual overlap of markers, I much prefer the REAPER razor edit functionality for vertical take work. It works a lot like the process shown in this Pyramix https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQXwnvITQCQ[video].

While Pyramix also has additional source-destination marker workflows, I couldn't help but feel that for professional ensembles that manage a high degree of tempo regularity between takes, this method can be extremely efficient. This isn't the document to introduce REAPER razor edits as there are plenty of resources online if you do a simple search. Here we are only concerning ourselves with creation of the razor area across all our pairs and spot mics (REAPER's default shortcut is the rather uninspiring Alt+Right drag). Thankfully, it can become the default editing mode by selecting the razor edit mode on the main toolbar and left-click dragging.

==== Crossfade Editor

Now that you've made your precise edits using S/D workflow or razor editing (no worries if it's a bit rough!), it's time to check things through with the help of the crossfade editor view.

Since v7.40, REAPER includes an excellent professional two-lane crossfade editor similar in nature to the specialist classical DAWs such as Sequoia and Pyramix. With the improved crossfade editor, users can see the continued "ghost" waveforms of the items beyond the crossfade they enter and likewise the previous waveforms of the items that exit the crossfade. The ability to visually align transients and then position the crossfade just before it is absolutely critical (and fun when you have the tools to do it!). Select the right-hand item of a fade (or hover over the item if `Add S-D Markers at Mouse Hover` is set to 1 in ReaClassical Project Preferences kbd:[F5]), press kbd:[F] and you are moved into crossfade editor mode. Note also that you are automatically centered on the crossfade and can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Press kbd:[F] again and you exit that mode.

So, now you are in the crossfade editor mode, my own preferred method of getting the perfect crossfade is to move the transient I want on the left (upper) item to just after the crossfade by dragging on the ghost waveform. Then I drag the "ghost" waveform of my right (lower) item so that the two transients align. That's it! Drag on the active part of the waveform to also move the location of the crossfade. You can just move or resize the crossfade by hovering directly over the lower portion of the crossfade and dragging either the edge or the shaded rectangle. Be aware that markers are not rippled in ripple-per-track mode (but with the introduction of the Create CD Markers, I highly recommend not bothering to create any markers at this point).

.ReaClassical Crossfade Editor View

In reality, this process can be just a few seconds to achieve the perfect edit. To ensure that previous xfades are unaffected, make sure that _Lock left-hand start_ is checked:

.Locking start of left item
image::xfade_left_lock.png[]

To audition material, hover the mouse inside the crossfade window and:

. press kbd:[A] to audition the crossfade with mirrored pre/post roll based on mouse cursor location
. press kbd:[S] to audition just the left item based on mouse cursor location or its mirrored position
. press kbd:[D] to audition just the right item based on mouse cursor location or its mirrored position

Use kbd:[Shift+A], kbd:[Shift+S] or kbd:[Shift+D] to do the equivalent but with a custom playrate as set in kbd:[F5] preferences.

You can shuttle between crossfades using the kbd:[Q] and kbd:[W] shortcuts. Please see the REAPER manual for more details of what is possible including phase alignment and various view options.

==== Other Editing Tips

In my key map, I include all sorts of useful shortcuts to use during editing. As mentioned above, in vertical editing workflows, the Audition function kbd:[A] is brilliant for listening to various takes before applying a razor or S/D edit. I can shuttle between items with kbd:[Q] and kbd:[W] (the same keys shuttle between crossfades in crossfade editor mode), shuttle between markers with kbd:[,] and kbd:[.] (the same keys with kbd:[<] and kbd:[>] on them on my UK keyboard), kbd:[S] for splitting a long recorded session into takes, kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+{cursorright}] and kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+{cursordown}] for zooming out to the whole project both horizontally and vertically etc. There are plenty more for the mastering end of things so I encourage you to explore.

It is worth noting that all regular markers and regions are ripple edited appropriately when using my source-destination editing functions and crossfade editor. I also introduced the ReaClassical_Lock Toggle function which temporarily locks all source groups and engages ripple-all-tracks mode to enable you to drag destination items and simultaneously ripple markers and regions in the regular arrange view. This allows vertical source groups to retain their independence yet still give ripple-all-tracks behavior which is useful for destination album track spacing etc. However, I consider this function deprecated given I strongly feel that the Create CD Markers function is now the ultimate way to deal with CD tracks/markers.
