=== Mastering

Mastering in ReaClassical is game-changing. Many features described here are not available in any other classical DAW. I hope that the _ReaClassical_ way saves you much time and helps you look forward to the mastering phase of the project. While automatic DDP generation, automatic room tone function, and professional album reports are the main features here, you will probably find the revolutionary automation mode is an extremely efficient way to add static mixer scenes across your production as well enjoying the ability to quickly reorder album tracks via a simple keyboard shortcuts.

==== Mastering Mode

Change to mastering mode via the shortcut kbd:[Ctrl+M]. In addition to making the mixer tracks, busses and RCMASTER available in the arrange window for setting static mixer scenes via envelope points, it also serves to de-clutter by hiding any source group audio. The hide and show child tracks shortcuts still work on the destination folder but in mastering mode also works on automation lanes. Simply select the relevant track connected to the lane and use the usual kbd:[E] and kbd:[D] keys to hide and show automation lanes. Look out for more _mastering_ mode features in the future.

==== Automation

Given ReaClassical is built on top of REAPER, it allows for same high-quality automation workflow with a ReaClassical twist. Beyond the following workflow descriptions, it is recommended to read the relevant REAPER manual section as there are far more features than can be described here. For example, you can add static mixer and FX _scenes_ to automation lanes (very useful for quickly setting up different settings for the various pieces on an album) . It makes most sense to leave any automation work until the destination group editing is largely complete. Start automation mode via kbd:[Ctrl+I]. Mastering mode will be enabled automatically as needed. All the envelope buttons will turn blue (_latched preview_) and you will see a message box with instructions. Simply set any desired mixer controls or parameters in an open FX window) on one or more tracks and press kbd:[I] to enter the values as points on the automation lanes at the edit cursor position or, if one exists, within the time selection. Continue to add, edit or audition and once completed, exit _automation_ mode via kbd:[Ctrl+I]. The envelope buttons will then turn green (_read_ mode). Hopefully this _ReaClassical_ way can make things faster and easier at the same time. Once multiple static mixes have been set up, you can then, of course, use more detailed automation via the pencil tool or riding the fader to, for example, temporarily bring up spot microphones.

In addition, there are also take envelopes that you can access via right-clicking on an item and going to menu:Take[Take Volume Envelope]. This is incredibly useful for transparently reducing very short stray peaks versus using a limiter. Simply create a selection over the problematic area by left-click-dragging and then kbd:[Ctrl+Shift] and drag up or down to just affect that portion of the envelope without needing to add in individual points. It's such a time-saver! The benefit here is that you can also see how the item waveform is affected in real time.

If you want to exit both automation and mastering modes, press kbd:[Ctrl+M].

==== Repositioning Tracks in an Album

There are two functions which help with reordering or repositioning tracks. First, and perhaps most useful for producing a classical album, is if you decide that you need to reorder one or tracks. Simply select the track you want to move and press either kbd:[Ctrl+{cursorleft}] or kbd:[Ctrl+{cursorright}] to switch with the track immediately to the left or right. Note that gaps are preserved too.

The other situation is when you want to start with uniform gaps between a series of short separate pieces. Use the kbd:[Ctrl+Y] shortcut and enter a value in seconds. Your pieces are then automatically spaced and items crossfaded are left intact.

==== Loudness

In terms of loudness, I personally aim for about -18 LUFS Integrated for my classical albums though it can be as high as -16 LUFS and as low as -20 LUFS. The new loudness JSFX meter in REAPER along with the normalization of loudness and true-peak limiting in the render dialog are priceless. It's another reason I couldn't go back to the big classical DAWs at this point.

==== Metadata

To quickly remove all the take names on the destination parent track, run kbd:[Ctrl+T]. Track titles are then added to the individual items on the destination parent track by double-clicking on the item or selecting and pressing kbd:[F2]. Note that only items that start tracks should be named.

The rest of the metadata is then added via the Create CD Markers function kbd:[Y]. You can add UPC/EAN and ISRC numbers as desired followed by album title, performer, composer and genre. On later runs of the function, you can choose to automatically re-use existing values which can save even more time when making last-minute S-D edits, altering album spacing, switching album track order, or renaming a CD track start.

==== Creating DDP filesets

I have introduced a workflow to automatically add the CD/DDP markers, regions and room tone automation via kbd:[Y](track and region names are pulled from item take names, markers/regions auto-snap to CD frames, initial 2-second pre-gap, silent roll out and album metadata also added!) . It is smart in the sense that if there's no take name, no marker or region will be created. In other words, press kbd:[F2] with an item selected to enter track names where markers/regions need to be created. It's perfect for classical releases where a crossfaded item is likely an internal source-destination edit versus a new track. For CD tracks that you want to have a visual CD player countdown, simply start the item name with an exclamation (!). Preferences such as CD marker offset, pre-gap length and album lead-out can be set via ReaClassical Project Preferences kbd:[F5]. So it's now very quick to export a DDP set!

TIP: If working in horizontal workflow, ensure that there is over a minute's worth of empty timeline between the end of the proposed album and any other source material. Instead, you can also choose to drag any source material to a new group by first creating an empty duplicate folder via kbd:[\ ].

Further, you can add audio to the initial pre-gap (an _easter egg_ track) by not giving the first item (or crossfaded items) a take name. The function will assume that this is supposed to be hidden and generate the initial pre-gap length accordingly.

If a room tone track is present in the project, the function will also generate precise track-level volume automation that creates perfectly-matching fades at points where items fade into and out of silence on the first destination track. In other words, slicing and dicing room tone audio to fill in digital silence is no longer necessary in ReaClassical!

For more information read the description of the DDP function in appendix A.

==== Creating CUE Files

A CUE file is automatically generated as part of the Create CD Markers function (kbd:[Y]). You can change the production year of the project as well as the CUE audio format in ReaClassical Project Preferences. The high-resolution audio portion can be generated separately in the render dialog via the preset. The naming defaults to that set by the CUE file which is the project filename followed by the audio extension set via kbd:[F5].

==== BIN+CUE set

Create a BIN/CUE pair (either select `regions define tracks` and render the whole project or select `use only # markers` and render by time selection if you don't want the first pre-gap as actual silence at the start of track 1).

==== Album Reports

When using the shortcut kbd:[Y], ReaClassical also generates both a plain text and HTML album report in the project folder including details such as pre-gaps, track title, start time, track length, UPC/EAN and ISRC (if present), total running time etc. This is a fantastic and automatic way to send information to clients or a duplication/replication factory.
