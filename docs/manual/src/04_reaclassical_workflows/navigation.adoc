=== Navigating a Project

In addition to built-in REAPER functions, ReaClassical uses a series of shortcuts to help you easily navigate your classical project. Important: I always make some dedicated time post-recording to get an overview of the recorded material, tidy up the digital notes I took during the session and perform a backup on an external drive as soon as possible.

==== Whole Project

Use kbd:[` ](backtick) to see the whole project horizontally and/or kbd:[Ctrl+`] to see everything vertically. I chose to separate these functions because one of the axes (often the vertical) is set exactly how you need for editing and it would be a pain to have the axis reset each time. You can also go to the start or end of the project by pressing the kbd:[Home] or kbd:[End] key respectively.

==== Finding Takes

Use kbd:[Enter] on the main keyboard or numpad if you have one to quickly search for a take based on the underlying filename of the media item. This will work for any file-naming system that uses numbers before the file extension such as _main_pair-T04.wav_, _cello-spot-take_23.flac_ or even _ortf_pair(04).wav_ such as created by Presonus Studio One. Note that if the imported or recorded files have zero-padding that is not a problem. If you have used an item to create an S-D edit, searching for a take will ignore these items and move directly to the original sources.

==== Jump to Time

Press kbd:[TAB] to jump to a specific absolute or relative time using right-aligned logic, similar to video editing applications. This can be an absolute time within the project or an relative position inside a selected item or a set of consecutive crossfaded items. Prefix with + or - to make relative jumps. Once you get the hang of using this input logic, moving to any position is extremely quick!

*Some Right-Aligned Logic Examples:*

|===
| Input | Meaning (based on project frame rate) 

| `100524`  
| Move to absolute position 10m 5s 24f  

| `1141711`  
| Move to absolute position 1h 14m 17s 11f

| `+8`  
| Jump forward by 8 frames

| `-1015`  
| Jump backward by 10s 15f

| `+23000`  
| Jump forward by 2m 30s (and 0 frames)

==== Items & Markers

You can easily shuffle back and forth between item edges by using the kbd:[Q] and kbd:[W] keys. You can move between markers by using the kbd:[,] and kbd:[.] keys (by design given on my keyboard they are the same keys that have kbd:[<] and kbd:[>]). 

==== Parents & Children

ReaClassical can hide or show children of track groups. This means that editing multi-track classical music can be as easy as editing a stereo track. When takes have been prepared (see below), all edits are automatically synchronized. Making an edit to the parent track automatically makes the same one to all the children too. To show hidden children select the parent track and press kbd:[D] (for _display_). To hide, select the parent track and press kbd:[E] (for _https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ensconce[ensconce]_). The other benefit is that a whole set of takes can be displayed vertically in the main editing window without too much effort.

==== Peaks Display

To adjust the visual zoom of wave peaks, use kbd:[Ctrl+{cursorup}] and kbd:[Ctrl+{cursordown}]. This is purely visual and allows for easier editing of quieter sections.

==== ReaClassical Toolbar

While I designed ReaClassical to be used efficiently with keyboard shortcuts, there is a custom S-D editing toolbar for those that prefer it. However I do highly recommend learning the key strokes as you will find your editing speeds improve dramatically. The floating toolbar is visible by default on a new portable install. To open or close, use the kbd:[F6] shortcut.

From left to right, we have: Destination IN and OUT markers (kbd:[1],kbd:[2]), Source IN and OUT markers (kbd:[3],kbd:[4]), Delete S-D markers (kbd:[Ctrl+Delete]), S-D Edit (kbd:[5]), 3-point _Assembly Line_ Edit (kbd:[F3]), Insert with Time-stretching (kbd:[F4]), Delete With Ripple (kbd:[Backspace]), Delete Leaving Silence (kbd:[Ctrl+Backspace]), Set Destination Tab Project Marker (kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+1] or kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+2]), Set Source Tab Project Marker (kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+3] or kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+4]), Delete S-D Project Markers (kbd:[Shift+Delete]), Copy Destination Material to Source, Move Destination Material to Source, Reverse S-D Edit (kbd:[6]), and finally ReaClassical Help (kbd:[H]).

==== ReaClassical Top Menu

At the top of the arrange window, you will see a dedicated ReaClassical menu (in between `Options` and `Extensions`). While not intended to be used as the primary way of running ReaClassical functions, it is an organized way of discovering the individual available functions and learning the keyboard shortcuts.

==== Summary of Track Types in ReaClassical

While some of these will be covered later in the manual, it is useful to give a summary of track types you can currently use in ReaClassical. First, we have the _regular_ group or groups of tracks shown in the arrange window. These are where you record or import takes. You can record-arm tracks and manually select inputs (if you didn't set during initial setup or via kbd:[Ctrl+F9]) here (a reminder that only locked tracks need only be set on the first group and then kbd:[F8] can be pressed to sync across all groups. Second, we have the mixer tracks designated via `M:` prefix. These tracks shown only in the mixer are where you adjust the usual track controls such as names, pan, volume, phase etc. and also add FX. Their names are synced across the project via kbd:[F7] or kbd:[F8]. Third, we have aux busses designated via `@` prefix. You can route mixer tracks to these to use as a reverb bus etc. Fourth, we have submix busses designated via _#_ prefix. You can route mixer tracks to these as a way to collect together microphones from the same orchestral section etc. Fifth, we have a dedicated room tone track where you can place recorded or generated room tone (more on this in the mastering section). Sixth, we have the _RCMASTER_ bus which leads directly to the master REAPER bus. Here you can gain stage into the master bus, add FX etc. Seventh, we have reference tracks which lie outside of the RCMASTER structure thereby allowing the user to quickly make comparisons with other imported material via the audition shortcuts. Finally, the master bus itself where again you can set final levels, add FX etc. As mentioned elsewhere, try not to delete the mixer tracks or RCMASTER. But, even if you do by accident, simply run kbd:[F7] or kbd:[F8] to recreate them depending on your chosen workflow.

IMPORTANT: Maintain the prefixes for the special tracks (`@`, `#` and `M:`) and retain the RoomTone, Reference and RCMASTER track names for audio routing and mixer visibility. However, if you accidentally make improper changes, simply re-sync via kbd:[F7] or kbd:[F8] to automatically add back missing prefixes and correct naming where appropriate.
